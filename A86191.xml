            <title>The key of Scripture-prophecies: or, A glass of some new discoveries. Being an answer to a book published by Mr John Elmestone. Wherein is resolved, 1. Whether a true constituted church, with true office and visible membership, together with the ordinances proper to such a Gospel-stating, continued true by a line of succession from the primitive time downward to our times: or whether it were not interrupted by the apostacie. 2.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian friends and Brethren in the Lord Jeſus, who are purchaſed from the reſt of mankind by the precious blood of the Lamb of God, and begotten by the incorruptbile ſeed of the Word to a life above nature; it is you I owne by the neareſt relation, under what title ſoever ſtiled; and to your wiſdoms principally I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect this Epiſtle, with the enſuing treatiſe. The true occaſion of this contending controverſie, you ſhall find in the front of the book, to be a combate with a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Miniſter, by whom I was provoked to enter into the liſt. The man (though clouded by ancient principles) I have eſteemed to be one of the ſealed number redeemed from the earth. The Manuſcript ſent by him in oppoſition to me, I received as the common mouth ſpeaking the mind of many, who are as much, nay more intereſſed in the cauſe pleaded for then himſelf: and thus much I may(as I ſuppoſe) ſay of it, that if it were his alone, it containes in effect the chiefeſt ſtrength a whole party can produce in their defence. We had rather receive the next return in the name of all, then to meet with the forces of all under the title of one.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:114948:3"/>
            <p> The ſubſequent Anſwer was a firſt by me written to be more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and not in the leaſt intended to come forth into publique view; it being a retired conteſt in it ſelf, and not clothed with the ordinary dreſs of elegancie ſutable to the guſt of this curious age, nor ſo exactly poliſhed, as might be required for the Preſs.</p>
            <p>But ſince, my Antagoniſt appearing in Print, in open oftentation, with the common applauſe of the Presbyters, who vote his book to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable, and many of my godly friends urging my be the moſt inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging tyes of entire affection, backed with this covincing argument, that the Lord gave me not a talent to hide in a napkin, I am willing to ſatisfie them and mine owne conſcience, and rejoyce to meet him in the hight of his and his parties confidence; as not fearing but the integrity of my cauſe, will bear me out againſt all oppoſition. For truth ſeeks not to be concealed in obſcure corners, but delights to come forth into open light, and preſent her naked beauty to the publique view of Nations. I am not ignorant that the ſubject with ſome ſearching reproofs (though drawn from Scripture-record) will be unpleaſing unto many at the firſt appearance; chiefly to ſuch who are tyed up, or much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared to their reſpective conſtitutions. Many are veiled by antiquity, the judgements and interpretations of learned men in former or latter times, whom they almoſt look upon as Oracles ſounding out nothing but undoubted truths, and adjudge its high preſumption in themſelves or other to ſwim againſt ſo full a ſtream. Theſe do not duely ponder in what a dark night our progenitors lived, nor how the truths of God brake forth by ſeveral ſteps and degrees out of that deep apoſtacie. My advice to ſuch is, to beware, that under the deriſive ſcorn of new lights, they blaſpheme not the diſcoveries of the Spirit ſtreaming out to a perfective alteration. Let them firſt examine before they cenſure. Others ſeem to look with more eagle-eyes over many generations into the pureſt primitive times; and erect new models of Churches, paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel (as they ſuppoſe) to their firſt, and moſt accompliſhed pattern; and this I am perſwaded the moſt do out of the ſincerity of their hearts. But they, not obſerving the Ceſſation and departure of the glory of God from the ptimitive Government, nor how Antichriſt had full power in that outward Court not rightly diſcerning the next immediate foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine whence a Goſpel-marriage flowes, nor marking the variety of Gods diſpenſations in ſeveral ſeaſons, imbrace ſhadows for real ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and ſet up beſtiall Idols inſtead of true Goſpel-Churches. I ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:114948:3"/>deſire them to conſider, that this manifeſt kingdome of God grounds not it ſelf on viſible faith, nor comes with obſervations and buildings up viſible forms, and then bringing Chriſt unto them, ſo as to ſay Lohere or there is Chriſt, but comes with power from above, being like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning deſcending downe from heaven, as ſhall be proved in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing treatiſe. The greateſt number being principled and guided by others of more eminencie, are ſo ſtrongly affected to what they have embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and walked in, that they account it no leſs then fighting againſt the waies of Chriſt, to diſcloſe their practice, or acquaint them with their miſleadings. For affection is blind, and can hardly be perſwaded to eſpie real deformities, in that object on which it repoſeth its delights. The Lord onely can, and in ſhort time will alter this eccentrick motion of his people, and turn the wheel of the heart to move concentrick to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>But this is common to them all, that to what way ſoever they are addicted, the whole face of Scripture ſeems to caſt a direct and favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able aſpect onely towards them; and to look upon others either more obliquely, or not at all. That as to one who hath the yellow Jaundiſe, the aire it ſelf, with every object he beholds, ſeems yellowiſh, ſutable to the diſtempered ſpecies in the eye; or to him who looks through red or green glaſs, or any coloured medium, the ſame things ſhew red, or green, or anſwerable to the colour of the medium which preſents them to his ſight: ſo thoſe Scriptures that are in themſelves uniform, beating their genuine ſignification, being veiwed through falſe gloſſes, or the deceiveable light of deluſive principles, ſeem to men of differing judgements to carry ſeveral repugnant ſenſes correſponding their miſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded apprehenſions. The intuitive action is then lureſt, when the medium is diaphanous, receiving that light of truth in its own purity, which irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diates and manifeſteth every colour in its proper kind; and when the underſtanding the eye of the ſoul, is like the cryſtalline humour, and the viſible ſpecies will complectioned in the bodily eye; to wit, clear, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, and capable of all colours, but infected with the tincture of none. Therefore the ſea, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 4.) by which the ſpiritual glory was diſcerned in the primitive times, was of glaſs like to Cryſtal, pure, unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured and ſhining, through which the ſeveral or contrariant colours were ſeen in their own peculiar dyes. Alſo in the new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> her light (the glory of God then ſparkling forth in the bright luſtre of that high diſpenſation) is like moſt pretious <hi>Iaſper,</hi> clear as Cryſtal, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.
<pb facs="tcp:114948:4"/>which ſeems to be one of thoſe ſtones called by <hi>Plinie, Aerizula,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemling the clear air, darkned with no colour which might cauſe an aberration in the ſight: likewiſe <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.12. her windows (the mirror to let the ſame light into the heart) are of <hi>Agats;</hi> the original word ſignifies as well Jaſper, or Cryſtal, which is moſt conſonant to that of the <hi>Revelation;</hi> by which the Spirit would teach us, that there is the ſame light within in the eye, that without is in the aire; in both which there is ſuch an unmixed and lightſome purity, as diſcovereth ſeveral ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in their naked hue; and all iſſues forth more immanently from God, according to that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>In thy light we ſhall ſee light, Pſal.</hi> 36.9. but this in the ſplendor of it, is beyond our times. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated people, who have gotten victory over the beaſt, ſtand upon a ſea of glaſs, in a more bright expanding Scriptures then in the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian ſtations, mingled with fire to burn up rubbiſh. With all the wrong ſtated corporations, there are humane beſtial thrones interpoſed between them and the higheſt throne, which like opacous bodies, cauſe an eclipſe of the countenance of him that ſits thereon; of which there be ſome groſſer, and occaſion the greater darkneſs, as in <hi>Rome;</hi> others more thin and rarified, but yet being mixed, and of divers natures, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent untrue and diſcording aſpects to ſuch who look through theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive mediums. When the 144000 ſealed ones who are now ſcattered in the wilderneſs, and ſecret chambers, ſhall like noble victors come off from the beaſt, and return with their faces toward <hi>Sion,</hi> the veil will be removed, whereby the ſemblance of Chriſt will ſhine more purely upon them; and they ſtanding on the aboveſaid ſea, behold his beauty through that glaſs with more open face: and I am ſure the ſenſes of Scripture ſeen by that tranſparencie, cannot bear ſo many oppoſite faces, as now they do, but will appeare in their more native and uniforme vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. For though the ſame text may have various ſignifications and proſpects, yet the variety is ſuch as meets in a unity, and is not deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to it ſelfe, as are the diſſenting axiomes of this our evill gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>My deſire is that the goldy Readers, who may now be ſevered one from another in judgement and practice, would with a ſingle eye ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred from the former gloſſes of their own and others, look into the inbreſt of thoſe prophecies produced in the following treatiſe; and they may perhaps, by the conduct of the Spirit of prophecie, find that truth, which may be as a ſpiritual clue to lead them out of their laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths,
<pb facs="tcp:114948:4"/>and reduce them into one fold, to travel together toward their deſirable reſting places.</p>
            <p>Now ſuffer me a little to reflect, and give you a compendious ſurvey of ſome occurrences happening unto me. I confeſs my ſelf to be one of the leaſt of the ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt; and in this particular ſubject was heretofore as blindfold as any. What I have ſince received, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg to the praiſe of his free grace only, who hath committed ſuch treaſure to a poor weak earthen veſſel; given indeed to further the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Antichriſt, but for your true edification. If I glory in any thing, it ſhall be in mine infirmities, that God may have all the honor. It was ſome nine yeers ago that the Lord in part ſhewed me the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the national Presbytery (for againſt Epiſcopacy I was ever ſince I came to yeers of underſtanding) with the unwarrantableneſs of that compulſive power they at that time laboured to obtaine: and then did I much affect and adhere to thoſe bodies called Independents (whom I yet look on as the more moderate, ſolid, and leſs rigid of all the ſtated companies:) and though I never was incorporated amongſt them, yet was I a ſtickler in their behalf as I met with opportunity. I found that Goſpel-Churches were not made up with people of all ſorts, but of ſuch men only who were Saints at leaſt in viſible appearance Iad. judged th office of the Presbytery derived from the Biſhops and ſo from the Pope, not to be legitimate: that Claſſical, Provincial and National Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods aſſuming a power over particular congregations, are the ſame Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy in the root with Epiſcopacy, and herein might be more dangerous and deſtructive, that whereas there were before but few, now there would be a multiplicity of Biſhops: that this is to bring a <hi>medium</hi> and husband-like authoriry betwixt Chriſt the husband and the Church the Spouſe; and to conform the Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of this world: that office by our Saviours rule was ſubſervient, <hi>It ſhall not be ſo amongſt you, Mat.</hi> 20.25, 26, 27. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.25, 26. That it is the property of the Locuſts, falſe officers, to have crowns on their heads. <hi>Revel.</hi> 9.7. that Goſpel-members muſt be a free willing people inlightned and conſtrained by the attractive vertue of the Spirit, and not compelled by humane Laws and Canons: that ſuch a forcing is againſt the nature of a marriage, which relative compacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to be combined by the mutual conſent of both parties, and not againſt the will injoyned by another: that ſeeing no power of man can create a principle of belief to this or that way, it were unreaſonable
<pb facs="tcp:114948:5"/>to command the action: that the ſpiritual life comes onely from Chriſt, and no man can come to him except the Father draw him: that the ſoul is the proper ſeat of God, and the Apoſtles weapons were not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but ſpiritual: that none are now infallible, nor can ſubſtitute ſuch unerring decrees which they dare affirm to be <hi>Jure divino,</hi> which Law alone takes place upon the conſcience: that this compulſion hath been the greateſt offence to render conſciences, the right hand of perſecution both in <hi>Rome</hi> under Epiſcopacy, and may be the like in Presbytery, many of whom are over-rigid: that it may for the future, as well as in times paſt, ſtop the free paſſage of new diſcoveries. Theſe and ſuch like arguments upon occaſion I produced, and proved at large againſt the national Presbytery; and thus far I went candidly.</p>
            <p>Now for the particular practice of Church-conſtitution, I began more narrowly to pry into the primitive platform; and in this diſſented from the reſt, that the Ordinance to receive into Church-fellowſhip, was not a Covenant and ſubſcription thereto, nor by giving the right hand of fellowſhip, but by laying on of hands. I drew out my model as exactly as I could to its firſt exemplar, and ſaw that many things could not be practiſed in their genuine order; but this I pieced up with the extream law of neceſſity. I concluded viſible faith to be the next immediate groundwork of the whole building; and in this laſt was my miſtake ſuch as overthrew all my former labour: and yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I for ſome yeers in this miſapprehenſion, though with ſecret ſtruglings and reluctances in the radix of my ſpirit. Till at laſt ſummoning up the ſtrength of my meditations upon that ſubject, I eſpyed that all my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del was but an outward form, voide of that Spirit of life, which breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the primitive order: that the glory of God was departed from thoſe ordinances I then plead for, and did not anywhere accompany their execution. I viewed a wider diſſimilitude from the primitive then before, and began to inquire the reaſon, why the ſame could not in many things be followed: why that was uniform, ours various; why that contracted and gathered the Saints into a unity, ours diſtracted and ſet the moſt pretious men at a vaſt diſtance, who before were one in brotherly love: that whatever ſcatters, gathers not with Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 12.3. I conſidered withall, that when Goſpel-Churches were in a right order Chriſt by his adminiſtration was ſo powerfully there, as to gather the Saints to him the dead carcaſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.28. by which like <hi>Aarons</hi> rod, it ſwallowed up all thoſe of the Magicians and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors;
<pb facs="tcp:114948:5"/>that to joyn to it, was to come to the <hi>general aſſembly,</hi> and <hi>Church of the firſt-born,</hi> Heb. 12.23. to ſeparate from it, was a manifeſt ſymptome of Apoſtacie, nay Reprobation, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Jude</hi> 19. to be excluded and ſhut out of this ſociety, was to be delivered over to Satan, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. that were as an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual name and power in theſe external keys to binde and looſe, to open and ſhut, which had clear effects on the parties, either to ingratiate, comfort, and appeaſe, or to terrifie or harden: that there was no admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Chriſt in what was altogether independent from it: And by comparing our new-built conſtitutions by this <hi>Norma,</hi> I found them altogether deviated, nay contradictory to their firſt copie to which they all pretend. I need not particularize in ſo evident a caſe; let any man enlightned view, and judge.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, in the behalf of the Independent Order, I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, that the above-named neceſſity, ariſing by the interception of Antichriſtiſme (the cauſe why the Primitive could not in its native way be practiſed) may diſpence with, nay in ſome caſes be above the Law, according to the Proverb: that the deadneſs of thoſe ſtative Ordinances, and the other defects in the right, might ariſe from the weakneſs of the diſpenſation now in the dawnings of light: which perhaps would obtain greater vertue in future ages: that the ſad dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences thereby ocaſioned might be <hi>ex excidenti,</hi> from the carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of men, and not from any evil in ſtating of Churches: that the Church muſt be upheld by Government; and for me to queſtion all viſible Conſtitutions, would be to oppoſe my judgement againſt moſt of Gods people, nay the ableſt men, and condemn their practice; both which will be accounted preſumptuous and uncharitable.</p>
            <p>Againſt this, my thoughts replied partly by way of Queries, that if the interception of that great Defection took away all poſſibility of practiſing the Primitive in its native method, Whether it did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate a ſink and interruption of that Order, eſpecially there being a myſtical <hi>Babylon</hi> and a ſpiritual <hi>Egypt</hi> coming between us and the ſame firſt day, in which all the Saints ſeemed to be captivated, as <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> was in the outward of old, and all our new-begun conſtitutions muſt neceſſarily imply ſuch a ceſſation, as alſo the call for ſeparation alluding to that of ancient times: Whether that fail might not occaſion an alterable diſpenſation, ſeeing different times have produced diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent changes in the outward body of Divinity, and the prophecies ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:114948:6"/>to look with divers faces on the primitive times and ours: Neither found I ſuch eminent good in any of our new-built Church-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, which might neceſſitate the changing of the Rule, nor any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for it in the Scripture, either by Precept or Type; they ſeemed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be obſtructive to the free paſſage of the Goſpel, and the cauſes of Rents among Brethren: Whether a Goſpel-marriage begun at all in weakneſs, or not rather with power to diſtinguiſh it from the Legal, which was more formal, as alſo from the falſe and Antichriſtian, and ſo fill it with ſpirit, whereby it might hold forth the lively preſence of the husband; that it did initiate with ſuch majeſtie in the Primitive, <hi>Acts</hi> 2, and the Prophets predict the like magnificent kingdom to come in ſucceeding ages: Whether as there was a preparing by <hi>John,</hi> and after by Chriſt's Miniſtery while on earth, and ſome ſpace of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after his aſcenſion, to diſpoſe the diſciples for the receiving that powerful diſpenſation, there might not now be the like preparatory work gradually to purge away Antichriſtian filth, and fit the Saints for that glorious adminiſtration to be revealed: Whether thoſe lively breathings, operating in the conſtitutive Ordinances of Confirmation, Ordination, Excommunication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in that firſt Goſpel-day, came not from the effectual emiſſion and blaſt of the Spirit ſent down by Chriſt; and whether the ſame winde was not the ſoul to eſſenciate and animate the key before promiſed, but not till then given. Here I began to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion my former miſtake, and enquire whether, if the Primitive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der failed, the placing the ſame upon viſible believers not poſſeſſed with ſuch power from on high to inſpire the ſaid keys with new breathings, was not <hi>privative</hi> (as the want of light is the cauſe of darkneſs, and of life deadneſs) the ground of that formality and emptineſs which is experimentally known to be in the above-ſaid ſtative Ordinances: whether this be not to lay another foundation, as bottoming that upon man, or any grace in man, that ought to lie only upon Jeſus Chriſt, and deſcends by a virtual influence from heaven: Whether the contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in ours from the primitive, do not ſymbole a difference in the cauſe, as ariſing from another principle, and having a different ſpirit, even that of Antichriſt, which though in pretence is moſt ſtrongly for Chriſt, yet in reality is moſt oppoſite to him: And whether our deplored diviſions and diſſentions amongſt the godly, raiſed by our diſunited Church-forms, do not originally flow from that other root Man, and that ſpirit of carnality, which rents and ſcatters: Whether the bright com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:114948:6"/>of Chriſt will eſtabliſh, or not rather aboliſh all theſe as Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and offences to his Kingdom. That a true Goſpel-ſtated-Church cannot have the keys of the Kingdom wanting, which have a name and power to accompliſh all the above-ſaid ends: That the Church of the Elect was preſerved by Chriſt, when all Eccleſiaſtical Rule was her enemy; and this outward Government hath, ever ſince the Apoſtacie, been experienced to be lifeleſs, and not to contribute one mite to the power of godlineſs, but hath rather increaſed formality, debate, ſtrife, quenched the noble grace of Love to all the Saints, and hath been averſe to the workings of the Spirit; and being thus prejudicial, ought to be detected, it being the great deſigne of God to anatomize the man of ſin in all his ſpecious deceits, and thereby free his people from defilement and bondage: That the talleſt cedars for parts and piety have been much blinded by the myſtery of iniquity; the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of whom in a higher light, hath procured the fall of many: That Antichriſt is not fully unmasked at once, but gradually by a conſumption; and hence there muſt be new and further diſcoveries of him, the firſt breaking forth whereof will be diſſonant to the maximes of the age pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding.</p>
            <p>Amidſt theſe and ſuch-like diſtracting and diſſenting motions, I was as a ſhip betwixt two ſeas, ſometimes toſſed one way, ſometimes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; my affections inclined more to the Independent Church-order, the ſtrength of argument ſeemed rather to prevail againſt it; and could finde no way out of this <hi>Meander,</hi> till entring into a nearer commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with my God, I received anſwer by a light of Spirit beyond mine owne, that the way to be reſolved in the caſe I deſired, was to abſtract my thoughts from all former conjectures of my ſelf and others and look nakedly into the Prophecies ſpeaking of the Antichriſtian times, the age we live in, and that to come, compared with the primitive. In the managing of which task, the ſame Spirit (who only knows the mind of God) directed and ſeconded my labours with ſuch ſucceſs, as made facile and eaſie what ſeemed before impoſſible; and revealed the ſenſe of thoſe Scriptures, which were till then ſealed up from my apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If my oppoſers deride, the Lord lay it not to their charge. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to the ingenious, pious, and impartial reader I ſpeak. You may view the moſt and cleareſt of thoſe Scriptures in the inſuing manuſcript. I ſhall adviſe you to take the counſel given to me, and you may perhaps reap the fruits of your indeavours. I found upon diligent ſearch, that
<pb facs="tcp:114948:7"/>there was a ſinke and diſſolution of the primitive Order; That <hi>Rome</hi> alone was not the whole woman <hi>Babylon</hi> (as hath been commmonly conceived) but that ſhe contained beſides the grand one, many harlots diſtinct in their form as daughters from the mother; and were after in time, and ſo younger, which muſt be new modelled Churches one diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from the other, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.5. that of all theſe were many defiled wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, chap. 14.4. that every one of theſe had for their foundation a falſe Chriſt or Antichriſt; and falſe Prophets, and ſo the woman being many, the falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophet are many accordingly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. That this whole <hi>Babylon</hi> (both mother and daughters) boaſting her ſelf that ſhe ſits a Queen in a viſible married conſtituted order, is a plain property, note, and mark of a falſe Church from the end of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive day, till the true marriage deſcends from God out of heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.7.</p>
            <p>Againe, I conſidered, that the Scripture holds forth not a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, but a direct ſeparation from thoſe defiled women and falſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches: and that the next path and way of Gods people after the 1260 yeers of tribulation, ſpecified in the following book, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce themſelves in their walk to the imitation of theſe types and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9. chap. 14.2.3, 4, 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> chap. 15.2.3, 4. <hi>Math.</hi> 25.1, 7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.20. which we have endeavoured to the utmoſt of our power. Moreover, I obſerved in minding the Scriptures, that there is in the entrance of the time of ſeparation a new returning Miniſtery, as a little book opened, and a pure Goſpel ſegregated from thoſe Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian mixtures publiſhed in the foregoing times of the Apoſtacy, prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (beſides many other place) by theſe texts, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.9, 10 11 12, 18.19. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. chap. 18.4. <hi>Math.</hi> 25.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.23. chap. 30.29. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> chap. 41.18, 19, 20. chap. 48. 20, 21. chap. 45.19, 20. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.10. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14 5 7 9. and 2 <hi>Eſ.d</hi> 11. 38 39, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> chap. 12.32.33.34. This is called, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.9. A returning to the people a pure language, thereby implying an impure before: and is ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a judging work. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96.13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.36. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.8. chap. 4.4. becauſe of its diſcovery of righteouſneſs, and declaring the judging wrath of the vials: it is alſo termed a new ſong, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98.1, 2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.9, 10 11.12.13.14. and a ſong chap. 24.14, 16. chap. 30.29.30, 31. new, as it anſwers to the new work then ariſing <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.19. and for that it is a pure Goſpel-ſong, which beats the glory of newneſs, in reſpect of the old waning apoſtated miniſtery:
<pb facs="tcp:114948:7"/>and a ſong, becauſe of its gladſome tidings, and the melodious joy that it bringeth and worketh in the hearts of the hearers. I gathered, that the ſum and ſubſtance of this Miniſtery was, to reduce all to God and Chriſt onely, both in Doctrine, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to cry down <hi>Babylon</hi> in her utmoſt extent, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the judgement written againſt the Beaſt, his Image and Mark in its whole latitude, alſo to unmask the ſpiritual drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, fornication, blindneſs, ſlumbering and ſleeping of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Nations; likewiſe to teach the coming and neer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the bridegroom, and the going forth to meet him by ſeparation. And withall, to teach up the finiſhing of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of God, as is evangelized (for ſo is the original) by his ſervants the Prophets, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.7. that is, to explicate the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies pertaining to our times, and the fulneſs of the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to come; and to expound the old Teſtament by way of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories and alluſions, bringing all the outward and hiſtorical nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to a Goſpel-unfolding, as looking into the myſtery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within the veil of the letter: and ſo to know the diſtinct times of the Prophets, both thoſe of their proper literal fulfilling, and that of their alluſive ſenſe and accompliſhment, extracting the quinteſſence of all, and applying it to our owne age and that ſucceeding. For this Miniſtery in its upſhot, beholds the eyes of the old Scripture in its furtheſt extent, as if the aſpect of its Evangelizing did centre in this laſt age; and therefore called the finiſhing of the Myſtery. That as the primitive Chriſtians backed their Miniſtery by the Prophets, and explained the old Teſtament by way of Allegories; ſo theſe returners confirme their everlaſting Goſpel by the Prophecies, and unfold the things of God in a figurative interpretation: and as they then did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by convince that of Judaiſme, ſo theſe diſcover more largely both it, and that of Antichriſtianiſme too, wherein the deepeſt myſtery of deceit reſideth. The diſpenſers of this laſt Miniſtery, muſt have the teſtimony of Jeſus which is the Spirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10. whereby to underſtand the minde of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, both for matter, and time; being herein like to the men of <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> who by a ſecret dictate were taught to be skilful in the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>imes, to know what <hi>Iſrael</hi> ought to do: which kind of
<pb facs="tcp:114948:8"/>people (though now deſpiſed by the Formaliſts of our dayes) will, I believe, in few yeers be counted very pretious and of high eſteem. This finiſhing of the myſtery is now but in its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and will not have its compleature of diſpenſation, till the marriage come, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. which was my next conſideration.</p>
            <p>I gathered what the meaning and myſtery of this laſt marriage is, by the ſtating of old <hi>Iſrael</hi> at mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> (<hi>Gal.</hi> 4.) and by that of the Chriſtians in the primitive (<hi>Matth.</hi> 22.) and found the ſame in the viſibility to belong to external Church-conſtitution and diſciplinal Order.</p>
            <p>It is be demanded whether the Elect were before during the apoſtacie in the eſtate of widowhood and non-marriage;</p>
            <p>I anſwer, They are not ſimply<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but reſpectively in regard of viſibility, as compared with the primitive marriage. For in this ſeaſon Chriſt was as one gone and long abſent, and theſe elect ones were in their outward ſtand ſtrangers in a ſtrange country, even in ſpiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> and there were under the rule of other lords: and therefore the Scripture ſeems to figure them out in the condition of a forſaken widow, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.4.</p>
            <p>Alſo we are to minde, that the ſame thing is ſet forth in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Types and Metaphors, as it hath a bent to divers reſpects: ſo the kingdome of heaven in the rule of grace is expreſſed by many parables, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. that thereby God may ſhew himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in his word, and what is wanting in the one, is ſupplied in the other, and ſo by this means there may be a fulneſs of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, knowledge and practice. Hereupon the godly in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regard, in the time of tribulation (when they were but few, little, ſmall and weak) are denoted in another type and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, to wit, in the form minority and youthhood, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.4. &amp; in the period of ſeparation (they proceeding to a higher growth and ſtature) are deciphered in the conditions of virgins, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.7. <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.4. and in the ſeaſon of the wedding-day (when they are come to more maturity and ready) are repreſented in the ſtate of a married wife, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.8.9.</p>
            <p>Finally, I took a ſurvey of other interpreters on the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe and ſaw by many reaſons, that they very were defective and much miſtaken in their ſenſes of the later Prophecies ſpeaking
<pb facs="tcp:114948:8"/>of our times and that enſuing; and that the later part of the ſaid Book, when the little book is opened, Chap. 10. muſt have a new interpretation both for time and matter: of which you may obſerve ſomething in the after-work, and concerning which, I may meet with occaſion to treat more amply in our next reply, if the Lord ſo diſpoſe it.</p>
            <p>But that I dwell not too long upon the Epiſtle, I ſhall onely ſpeak a few words of the following Book, and ſo conclude. I confeſs the ſtile is plaine, and ſomething rude: plainneſs I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, that it might be ſutable to the meaneſt capacity: the more unpoliſhed it is, becauſe the moſt are my firſt and ſudden conceptions. For conſtant exerciſe in ſpiritual imployments, and multitude of neceſſary worldly incumbrances, would not permit me times of abſolute repaſt and ſolitude, to recollect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce my thoughts into an exquiſite compoſure. Alſo ſome Scriptures are often repeated, occaſioned partly by neceſſity, it being but one caſe in the root; in proſecution whereof I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to uſe the cleareſt and moſt pertinent texts, partly by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Maſter <hi>Elmeſtones</hi> multiplicity of Arguments meeting in the ſame baſe, together with ſome repetitions of his in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the ſame in ſundry places of his book: and for the better reſolving ſuch knots where I met with them, I made uſe of thoſe Scriptures which were elſewhere proved more at large that the weak might be thereby the better ſatisfied in particulars. Such who are more intelligent, may diſpenſe with what may be for the benefit of lower apprehenſions. And I doubt not but they that are ſpiritually prudent, will prize the naked and ſolid Truths of God, delivered in the plain language of the Word, before the adulterate ſhadows of carnal Reaſon, though glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſpecious habit of humane Eloquence.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian and ſincerely pious Reader, though this ſubject may ſeem new and ſtrange, and the Scriptures dark and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful at a ſudden glance; yet he that will bring to paſs his act, even his ſtrange act, hath promiſed to make dark things light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and crooked things ſtrait: and upon a ſerious refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, you may finde the accompliſhment of the ſame promiſe
<pb facs="tcp:114948:9"/>bleſſing your endeavours, and removing the veil to ſhew you the inward beauty of thoſe Prophecies aſpecting your own ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; which will direct you to imbrace and walk in the right path caſt up by the Spirit, and to avoid thoſe accurſed things that will bring a general deluge upon the ſecure world: that while darkneſs covers the earth, and groſs darkneſs the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, his light may ariſe upon you, till at laſt his glory be ſeen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you.</p>
            <p>Now, that the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and Father of glory, may give unto you the Spirit of wiſdome and revelation in the knowledge of himſelf, is the deſire and unceſſant prayer of him who is.</p>

It ſeems, it much grieves you to ſee the tenth part of the great City falling in our dominions, and that our States refuſe to aſſume a Popedom over the conſcience, the peculiar ſeat of divine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. However you judge, it will be the honour of our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies in future ages; and all neighbor-Commonwealths are amazed at the glory reſting upon our <hi>Engliſh</hi> nation.</p>
            <p>But Sir Why ſhould this toleration be more deſtructive to you, then to others? You have as great a portion therein as any: you thereby injoy a freedome for your walk which was
<pb facs="tcp:114948:10"/>denyed in the Biſhops reign: and when ſo large a door is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in riſing times, if your Church cannot ſtand, unleſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-propped by worldly power, it evidently demonſtrates your kingdome to be of this world.</p>
            <p>Be pleaſed to remember, that the primitive was not built by might nor power, but by the Spirit, <hi>Zech. 4.6.</hi> and by the ſame Spirit Chriſt went forth conquering and to conquer mulittudes. <hi>Rev. 6.2.</hi> Alſo the ſtone daſhing all oppoſers in theſe latter dayes, is cut out of the mountaine without hands, <hi>Dan. 2.34.</hi> the kingly Prophet tells us, Gods people will be willing, or voluntaries (as the Hebrew text carries it) in the day of his power, <hi>Pſal. 110.3</hi> and <hi>47.9.</hi> The Goſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>el-Saints are genuinely of a royal princely ſpirit, and never act nobly but from a pure principle of love within conſtraining. <hi>2 Cor. 5.14.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You argue, <hi>That out of this womb hath iſſued, forth numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hereſies, errors, ſects and ſchiſms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some of theſe named indeed are dangerous, ſome are neerer to the truth then your ſelves: but to reply to yours, we aſſert,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That all thoſe nominated in your Epiſtle (the Ranters excepted, who in their blaſphemies and beaſtly luſts are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded) were brought forth many yeers before this toleration was granted: and it is a ſtrange Paradox, never heard of in publike till divulged by you that that can be the womb to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and bring forth, which with as was not <hi>in retum natura,</hi> extant in the ſeries of nature, till ſo long time after their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence. Formerly it was an approved Aphoriſme, <hi>Cauſa eſt prior effecto,</hi> The cauſe precedes the effect in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or time, or both. But you produce a contrary example, which (if true) will put all Logicians to an abſolute <hi>non-plus.</hi> We conceive the rationaliſt, rather then be ſilenced, will tell you, <hi>Contra principia negantem non eſt diſputandum,</hi> no diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ought to be held with him that denyes the principles. Surely, it is heat of paſſion againſt the Sectaries (as you term them) hath diſturbed your otherwiſe more ſolid intellectuals.</p>
            <p>To proceed, ſuppoſe errors may ariſe, yet is it not carnal, but ſpiritual weapons muſt beat down ſuch ſpiritual wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>2 Cor. 10.3, 4.</hi> The Lord permits, and the Scripture
<pb facs="tcp:114948:11"/>preſageth, that errors and offences muſt come, partly that thoſe who are approved may be made manifeſt, partly that the conqueſt of truth may appear the more glorious, which will at laſt diſpel thoſe gloomy clouds, and ſhine forth with more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous brightneſs. The myſtery of godlineſs rayes out with moſt perfect beauty, by the clear diſcovery of the deepeſt myſtery of iniquity.</p>
            <p>Beſides, why may not truth in a free paſſage come in, as well as hereſie? Without doubt Chriſt, who hath all power committed to his charge, is as potent to prevaile in light, as the Prince of darkneſs in deluſions. Nay, why may not truth be ſhut out by the contrary reſtraint? The compulſion you plead for, hath hither to proved a direct enemy to the pure Goſpel of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>It may further be demanded, to what way you ſo eagerly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to ingage the ſword of the Magiſtrate, whether to your own, or to ſome other. Not to any other; for when the Biſhops held it in their cuſtody, you did with the formoſt exclaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it as Antichriſtian beſtial, tyrannical <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and here you cenſure all others to be errors, Sects, Schiſms, and what not?</p>
            <p>If you chalenge it to your ſelves we ſhall ask whether you, among all the ſeveral bodies extant, ſit in the chaire of infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility? For none but an unerring law can warrantably claim a power over the conſcience. <hi>2.</hi> Suppoſe you were infallible, and could not err (which you dare not affirme) then whether you can create a belief the heart of thoſe who are contrary minded.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles in Church-affaires, were directed by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceivable ſpirit: an yet neither uſed nor layed claim to ſuch a power, but invited and won men to the faith ſimply by the cords of love. All that humane weapons can do, is only to force the outward man, which is a violent and preternatural motion; and when the conſtraint is over ſoon turns again to its own centre. Whereas the Goſpel naturally begins within, and grounds its principles in the intimate cheſts of reaſon. It firſt breaks as a light into the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, the nobleſt faculty, and there imprints the image of its integrity; thence it goes to the Will, the great wheel of the ſoul, and turns it to
<pb facs="tcp:114948:11"/>a willing obedience to all its precepts and commands; thence it paſſeth to the inferiour affections, and compels them to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the beauties of holineſs; and from theſe inward ſprings proceed all the outward duties and ſervices performed by the body. The ſum of the new Convenant is to write the laws in the heart, and in the mind. <hi>Heb. 8.10.</hi> This was exactly the method which the Apoſtles followed. <hi>2 Cor. 3.2.3.</hi> But you indeavor a prepoſterous courſe, and contrary to the order of the Goſpel, to wit, to conſtrain the body to what the heart oppoſeth. If ſo, and whatever be not of faith be ſin then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly this your courſe is confuſion; and deſtructive to the ſouls of people. We read of none in all the New Teſtament but only the beaſt, who commanded all, both ſmal and great, to worſhip, <hi>Revel. 13.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> It is conceived that you in this are a part of the greateſt and moſt deceivable Schiſme that ever came into the world: and if Epiſcopacy be to be plucked up root and branch (which you pleaded) then no reliques of your Claſſical government will be left remaining: much leſs will it be granted, that you ſit in the ſeat of judicature to adjudge all beſides your ſelves to be Hereſies, Sects <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or that you have any authority given from heaven by humane force to captivate them to your wills and canons. The Independents are in many reſpects in their way neerer to the Kingdome of Heaven, then the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical men: and if you would not willingly ſubjectly your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to the ſeparation (which power they defie to own) why ſhould there be ſuch high indeavors to imbondage them? In this you are declared to be far beneath a legall ſpirit, which teacheth to doe to others as you would be dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all by them. Are not their conſciences as tender as yours? Are they not as pious and dear to GOD, as upright to their neighbour, as ſerviceable and faithful to the State, as cordial and real to our publike Cauſe? And why ſhould they not with others partake in that common priviledge purchaſed by the expence of many of their deare lives?</p>
            <p>It was not long ſince your ſelves were under the Biſhops rod, and then ſuch a liberty would have been ſweet and
<pb facs="tcp:114948:12"/>gratefully accepted: but now nothing will ſatisfie, unleſs you may in their ſteads lord it over your fellow-brethren. The precept is ordinary, yet profitable, <hi>Foelix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.</hi> Let the ruines of other tyrants, teach you more wiſdome and moderation.</p>
            <p>In the next place you come unto me and our walk in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, in which (to paſs by other phopperies opprobrious deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and falſe ſuppoſitions, as not worth ſpending inke, paper, and time upon) we ſhall only take notice of two paſſages. The firſt is your calling it <hi>a Sect,</hi> and in the title of your Book <hi>a Schiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> A Sect is a renting, a Schiſm a cutting off or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the truth: now whether we or you be renters, we leave to the tryal of the Word. It hath been the uſual policy of Satan to brand the new ſpringings forth of truths by ſuch opprobrious titles. Thus dealt the Jews of old with the Goſpel, <hi>Acts 28.22. Chap. 24.5, 14.</hi> and ſeparation being now that which God calls his people to walk in, we believe, this charge of yours will be found to be as untrue and calumnious, as was theirs, and to come from the ſame ſpirit. We ſhould have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected no other language from the mouth of a Pope or Biſhop: but wonder to hear it from one who would rank himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the godly. However, we regard not the cenſure of your papal chaire, as being neither diſcovered to be what you ſtile us, nor diſcouraged by ſuch diſgraceful Characters: for we are not aſhamed to bear the rebukes of Chriſt. Your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors this way, will prove but bare Eſſays, whoſe births may be vanity and ſhame at concluſion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You come to our company, whom you call unſtable ſouls, and defame their aſſemblings by baſe ſcurrilous verſes out of <hi>Ovid,</hi> the very language of hell, and unfit to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by a chaſte pen, much more unmeet to be applyed to a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or hopeful people. For my own particular, as I have freely received, ſo I freely diſpenſe the word, and deny none to hear who are freely drawn; as being ſenſible of the power of God, who may chuſe the mean and baſe things in the worlds eſteem, to confound the noble. Notwithſtanding were the ſame people with you, many would be counted pretious Saints,
<pb facs="tcp:114948:12"/>others very faire commers on, though now from a root of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs they are ſo greatly vilified. Such virulent invectives tend but to the fulfilling of the Prophecies, which foretell, that the meetings of theſe returners ſhall bear a reproach and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <hi>Ezek. 34.16. Mica. 4.76, 7. Zeph. 3.18.</hi> albeit in ſhort time, they ſhall have a praiſe and a fame in every land, where they have been put to ſhame, their gathering or congregating being by the Lord Jeſus ver. <hi>19.</hi> I cannot in charity think that theſe came ſimply from your ſelf, but from the inſtigation of ſome others whoſe ſpirits are compounded of gall and vinegar, and have dipt your pen with the cruel venome of Aſps. We are ſure, ſuch ribaudry becomes not the gravity of gray hairs, much leſs of one esteemed an ancient profeſſor.</p>
            <p>It ſeems their throne being touched their kingdom waxing dark, and people leaving them they begin to accompliſh what is ſpoken <hi>Revel. 16.10, 11.</hi> The Lord open the eyes of their underſtandings, that they many no longer be found fighters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. Before we paſs from hence, we ſhall mind you of a ſeaſonable obſervation. In the Primitive time there was an outward Jeruſalem, figured by <hi>Hagar</hi> the bond-woman, whoſe zealous children, under high pretences of holineſs, were the moſt deſperate enemies to ſuch who by their free Goſpel-walk, declared themſelves to be the off-ſpring of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from above: So now there is an outward rejected court, <hi>Rev. 11.2,</hi> and thereupon another inſlaving motherhood; and thoſe who are over-rigid in thoſe externalities, and ſtand moſt upon them, are like to prove the greateſt enemies to ſuch, who by their practiſe of ſeparation manifeſt themſelves to be children of liberty, and aim moſt at ſpirituality.</p>
            <p>But leaving this, we ſhall ſpeak ſomething of our firſt Letter, after the receit whereof (as you affirme) it was noiſed, that I had thereby blown up <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If there were any ſuch report, the ſound of it was not loud enough to come to my ears, till I read it in your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle. This I am ſure of, it was a private Letter, never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the writer to come publikely abroad in the world, and compriſed but a light and haſty draught of my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions touching the ſubject you requeſted; whoſe principal
<pb facs="tcp:114948:13"/>ſcope was to proffer you a fuller diſcourſe by word of mouth, upon the particulars therein barely hinted. But ſince you being pleaſed to divulge it in your book without my knowledge or approbation, I ſhall only remark two paſſages.</p>
            <p>The firſt is a miſtake in printing, in the ſecond page and ſeventeenth line. It is printed, <hi>We are in our journey to Sion vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſeparated;</hi> whereas it ought io be, <hi>To Sion viſibly ſtated;</hi> and ſo it was written in my Letter; alſo <hi>Revel. 8.34.</hi> for <hi>Revel. 8.5.</hi> in the third page.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is (as you aſſert) that I quoted <hi>Iſa. 66.5.</hi> for <hi>Iſa. 56.5,</hi> which error you not finding out, ſaid nothing on that place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There were ſome ſuch errors in yours inſuing, which when the words were written, I rectified, and replyed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: and it is poſſible that amongſt many Scriptures, I might faile in the quotation of one: yet the words of the text being named, your Concordance might ſoon have directed you to finde out the place; ar elſe within the compaſs of eight or nine moneths (for ſo long ſpace it was ere your returned me anſwer) you might have inquired of me, we living ſo neer one to another. You neither have, nor (I ſuppoſe) ever can in your ſenſe give a ſolid interpretation of that Scripture. There be ſome other places rightly pointed out, which you paſs over with utter ſilence, though very material to this caſe: namely thoſe produced to prove a new pouring out of the Spirit when the marriage again comes, as <hi>Iſa. 32.15. Ezek. 37.9. Mat. 24.27, 28. Pſal. 97.4.</hi> anſwerable to that in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>Acts 2. Ezek. 1.4. 1 Timoth. 4.14.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We cannot omit another paſſage: Your book is not dated in the beginning, according to the uſual manner, but at the end of your Epiſtle, and there bears date <hi>Auguſt 18.</hi> whereas it came not out till <hi>December,</hi> neer four moneths after. Whether this be double dealing, to make the Reader believe that we are <hi>tardè</hi> in our reply, is beſt known to your own conſcience. Thus far in anſwer to your Epiſtle.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He diſcoveries and new breakings forth of light, after great and epidemical Apoſtacies, have always met with ſtrong oppoſitions and ſharp encounters: and though Truth at firſt be ſtill blamed with the names of Novelty, Errour, and what not? yet, as unaſhamed, it hath been bold as a lion, to face againſt all diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, and at concluſion carried with it the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant palm of Victory. This is that Jewel we are now contending for: the original of which conteſt was a Letter ſent me by you, to requeſt me to impart thoſe points I had newly taken up, and what my opinion was about your Presbyterian way. To ſatisfie your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, I returned you a brief account of what you required in writing: and to avoid the long tediouſneſs of the Pen, invited you to a more full and ample diſcourſe on the ſubject now in debate, by word of mouth. Your Manuſcript coming ſince, declares, that your leaſure would not permit a Verbal diſpute, (which I conceive had been far eaſier, then to anſwer ſo largely in writing.) You tell me withal, that you received my Letter, as a teſtimony of my good opinion of, and good will towards you; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deliberate peruſal profeſs, that my Principles appear not ſo ſolid, as you can cloſe with them. Had it not been for the cauſe above expreſſed, I ſhould have been more full, methodical, and clear, in committing my Pen to Paper: but what I ſent, (I aſſure you) came from the right hand of true affection: and it may be, that ancient and long fixed Principles, may reject as unſound the Orthodoxal Truth of Jeſus Chriſt. He that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114948:14"/>hath drunk old wine, doth not ſtraightway deſire new, but thinks the old is better. However, the ſolidneſs of thoſe tenents will appear, when they come for trial to the Touch-ſtone of the Word of God. I deſire that in combating for the Truth, we may keep <hi>the Royal law of love:</hi> and ſhall endeavour, as to be free from bitterneſs and paſſion, ſo to avoid the other extreme of Partiality and ſoothing; and in a <hi>medium</hi> betwixt theſe two Rocks, faithfully diſpenſe that talent the Maſter hath given me.</p>
            <p>The main Queries controverted betwixt us, are theſe two:</p>

               </note> 
               <hi>Whether a true conſtituted Church, with true Office and viſible Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, together with the Ordinances proper to ſuch a Goſpel-ſtating, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation or laying of hands on Members, Ordination or laying hands on Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Suſpenſion, Excommunication, Admiſſion, Abſolution, retaining of ſins,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>continued true by a line of ſucceſsion from the Primitive time downward to our times: or whether it were not interrupted by the Romiſh Apoſtacie.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It will be requiſite to clear up theſe two together, as a preparative and ground work to our enſuing Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>We will begin with the Firſt,<note place="margin">Ceſſation.</note> and evidence the Ceſſation of viſible Church-conſtitution in myſtical <hi>Babylon.</hi> We ſhall lay down this for a ſure Maxime, That every thing hath its being and continuance from the Word of God. Now whatever in Goſpel-times if fore-declared and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the Scripture for abiding, that did not fail, but was upheld by the power of the Word through all the times of this Apoſtacie: as the Ordinances of Miniſtery, Prayer and Praiſes, Baptiſm, the Communion, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.16, 17, 18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.13. Chap. 11.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.13. Chap. 56.5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. as alſo a ſealed elect number with their ſpiritual union, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.4 5, 6, 7, 8. Chap. 9.4. Chap 11.1. Chap. 14.1. likewiſe the being and profeſſion of faith, duties of charity, with all moral precepts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.17, 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.1. with whatever elſe is promiſed to continue. But what is not ſo perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in the Word, (as Confirmation, Ordination, Church-Cenſures, with the primitive order or Church-ſtating) was corrupted, and turned into confuſion by the great Antichriſt, it wanting the ſame Word and Promiſe to uphold its abiding.</p>
            <p>For proof whereof, we will begin with <hi>Iſai.</hi> 56.5. which was a prophecie beginning with the primitive Goſpel-Church, and the ingrafting of the Gentiles thereinto; as appears, verſ. 1. by the ſalvation coming, and the righteouſneſs (the Goſpel-Miniſtery) then revealed: alſo the ſtranger then joyning himſelf to God, and the Eunuch, the dry tree before, then taking hold of the Covenant, verſ. 3, 4. muſt allude to the Gentiles, who in times paſt were dead, without Chriſt and hope, aliens from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſtrangers from the Covenants of promiſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1, 12. and were then ingrafted into the true Olive-tree, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17, 19.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114948:14"/>the ſons and daughters muſt be the jewiſh Church, who before was a married wife, and her members children, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.27. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.22, 24, 26. again, verſ. 8. the gathering of others beſides thoſe who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gathered, ſhews them to be the primitive Gentile-Chriſtians, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.16. To this Eunuch, theſe Gentiles are fore-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied, that they ſhall have [a place and a name better then the ſons and daughters] the Jews: the event declares that they had both in the primitive, according to this prediction: but afterwards, when the Spirit annexeth a perpetual ſucceſſion, it ſingles out the name by it ſelf, leaving the place behinde: [I will give them an everlaſting name, that ſhall not be cut off] The word interpreted <hi>place,</hi> is in the Hebrew]? <hi>ſad,</hi> which ſignifies a hand, as alluding to Church-power. Now why ſhould not the place be ſaid to be everlaſting, as well as the name, eſpecially being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both joyned together, if the Spirit had not ſeen the fail and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the chain thereof? This alſo fell out anſwerably: for the name <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or <hi>Iſrael</hi> remained, but the viſible Church-order became <hi>Babylon;</hi> both which ſhall be proved in their place.</p>
            <p>From thence, turn to <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18. where you may obſerve, that to the profeſſion of <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſaith, and Chriſt the Rock believed, is foreſpoken that the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it: but verſ. 19. the keys of binding and looſing, opening and ſhutting, are ſet after, as having no ſuch promiſe annexed to them: and why ſhould this be, but to ſhew that theſe keys in the Churches hand, ſhould receive a ſink and loſs of their efficacie for a time? For certainly the Lord knowing the apoſtated times, if they had continued through the Babyloniſh defection, would have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome word of remaining to them, as well as to the profeſſion.</p>
            <p>To theſe we ſhall annex that, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.2, 12. in which we may behold that related as evidently, as the face is ſeen in the glaſs. The Angel, verſ. 2. ſets before the eyes of <hi>Zechariah</hi> the image of the primitive Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Church; the like was alſo ſeen of <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 1.12, 20. onely here was the difference; the Prophet ſees the type of one Candleſtick, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the Church in her unity; <hi>John</hi> beholds ſeven, he writing to the ſeven Churches: and here in verſ. 12. is pictured out a platform of the diſpenſation of the ſealed elect number, during the times of Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſm.

That the two Olive-branches and the two golden pipes, verſ. 12. pertain to the next following Antichriſtian times, is apparent by the decreaſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fulneſs, and the anſwer of the Angel, verſ. 14. which can aptly be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to no other time, then that of the elect in <hi>Babylon.</hi> From hence we ſhall evince this argument, That there was a fulneſs of Ordinances in the primitive Age; there were ſeven pipes to the ſeven Lamps, verſ. 2. the number ſeven notes out a perfection; the Pipes ſignifie Ordinances, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.32. theſe being the organ by which the light and oil of Miniſtery is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played: whereas in the Antichriſtian ſeaſon, there are ſeen but two pipes that had golden oil, the leaſt of numbers, and yet ſufficient to teſtifie the truth of inward grace. Now why ſhould there be ſeven at the firſt, and but two at the laſt, but to ſet forth the ceſſation of the former five in their efficacie and power, as being dead, empty, and without golden oil, <hi>viz.</hi> Ordination, Confirmation, with the other ſtative Ordinances? and that Miniſtery, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being predicted of God for abiding, muſt as the two golden pipes remain, and the two anointed ones by theſe empty themſelves, as the two Olive-branches.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.1. the four open windes (which are <hi>cauſa procreans &amp; conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans,</hi> the begetting and preſerving cauſe of theſe viſible keys, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.) were by reaſon of the falling away wholly with-held from their apparent blaſt: and the cauſe failing, the effect muſt alſo ceaſe: this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life being reſtrained, they muſt needs be meerly formal. That as in the Scriptures before cited, they were not promiſed to abide; ſo the Spirit doth here deſert and leave them empty of its lively influences.</p>
            <p>In Chap. 9.1, 2, 3. the Angel (who had uſurped all Church-power into his cuſtody) totally apoſtated from heaven to earth, becomes a meer earthly Angel, by which that Church-policie that before was a kingdom of heaven, is become a bottomleſs pit, or a falſe Church, without any bottom of Truth in her order; and in ſtead of the keys of the celeſtial kingdom, was another contrary key of the ſame bottomleſs pit, the key being the ſame with the Church: in the room of that ſweet recreating winde, or lightſome ſmoak, deſcending from Gods glory, to beget the truth of Office, was the dark and deluſive ſmoke or diſpenſation aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from this bottomleſs furnace, which ingenders none but locuſts, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate brood of falſe Officers. Here we may take notice of the effects that enſue upon the former with-holding of the windes: God having forſaken and left it void, Satan hath full power, gives another key, with other ſmoke, whereby of Chriſt, all is become Antichriſt, and bottomleſs of Truth.</p>
            <p>In Chap. 11.2. where, though the Temple was meaſured, of which we ſhall ſpeak anon, yet the onward court was excluded, and forbidden to be meaſured; for ſo ſaith the Spirit, The court without, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, <hi>cast out.</hi> That this outward court muſt belong to the viſibility of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114948:15"/>Church-government, may be cleared by theſe Arguments. 1. Becauſe this, as oppoſed to the Temple within, muſt be the exteriour outward part: and who knows not, that the Order of Eccleſiaſtical Government, is the outſide or viſibility of the Church? 2. Becauſe this here excluded, was given to the Nations: the inward rooms of true grace with Worſhip flowing from thoſe internal ſprings, was never in the power of man to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle with: but the outward court of Church-Regiment was in the hands of Nations for many generations, and nowhere elſe. 3. Becauſe the Nations by enjoying this outward court, did tread the holy City un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot. Now woful experience hath taught the Saints, that that by which Antichriſt hath trampled upon the godly, was by ſitting in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternality of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, in Spiritual Courts and Claſſes. The four windes above reſtrained, muſt be from this rejected Court; the bottomleſs key, pit and ſmoke in this unmeaſured to Truth.</p>
            <p>In Chap. 12.6, 14. the ſame externality given to the Nations, and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with worldly things, becomes a worldly wilderneſs into which the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fled. That this wilderneſs is the National Babyloniſh Church, is proved at large by Scripture and the analogie, in <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. of the firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph.</p>
            <p>In Chap. 13. the Principality or chief of the power ruling here, is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a wilderneſs-beaſt, compared with <hi>Mark</hi> 1.13. anſwerable to thoſe falſe chriſts and falſe prophets which our Saviour foretold ſhould be in the wilderneſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. The ſecond Beaſt is here called a falſe prophet, inferring the firſt to be a falſe chriſt or Antichriſt, as is ſhewed in our anſwer to him on <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.</p>
            <p>In Chap. 17. the Church born up by this Beaſt, is called <hi>Myſtery Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> as being another, and diſtinct from Sion in her very foundation, who alſo was ſeen of <hi>John</hi> in this wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>To ſum up all, if we conſider the Goſpel-times aright, as they are pourtrayed in the Prophecies, we ſhall finde, that in the primitive, there was the ſmoke of Gods glory preceding, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.4, 9. compared with <hi>John</hi> 12.40. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.2. by which, the viſible keys of Church-power were given and ſanctified: but after, when the Angel fell, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.1, 2, 3. another earthen helliſh key with other ſmoke ariſing from the pit, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and baniſhing the lightſome glory of the former, as above; and at laſt a new ſmoaking of the Temple from Gods glory, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.8. a new opening and entering, implying key and doors; all ſhewing that there was no opening nor entering, but a ceſſation and ſhutting of the true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible betwixt theſe two days. Beſides, there is a new open breathing of the four windes of the Spirit, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.9. after the long reſtraint of the primitive blaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.4. a new pouring of his Spirit, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 32.15. after the former hiding of his power: a new Marriage and Marriage-call, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.7, 9. beſides the Marriage at the firſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. a new lightning, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.27. beſides the lightning at the primitive, <hi>Ezck.</hi> 1.4, 13, 14. all teaching a non-continuance of this glory. Again, there
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114948:16"/>was an inviſible day between the bright ſhining day at the firſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.22. and the like glorious day again at the laſt, verſ. 24. an inviſible kingdom, as that within, verſ. 21. paſſing between the open kingdom of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and the manifeſt kingdom of God at the laſt, Chap. 21.31. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.6. Chap. 11.17. all clearing up this ceſſation. The viſibilities, <hi>Lo here and there,</hi> were falſe and deluſive.</p>
            <p>The event hath made all this as perſpicuous as the ſun ſhines in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen firmament, to thoſe who will not obſtinately and of ſet purpoſe ſhut their eyes againſt it; to wit, That there was an apparent and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Apoſtacie darkning and ſwallowing up all the bright Order of the primitive. For that Church (after <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had ſully ſubdued the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperors, and ſetled all in outward tranquillity, about the yeer of our Lord 327, as the margin on <hi>Socrates</hi> hath it, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.) beginning to conform to and mix her ſelf with National and worldly things, dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated and daily declined by the four firſt trumpets, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. till at laſt by the fifth the ſtar totally apoſtated from heaven to earth, about 390; and then the key of external Rule became purely National, and was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the juriſdiction of Popes, Patriarchs, Biſhops, and earthly Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, who alone uſurped all Church-power into their hands. In all our Weſtern Globe, there was no Church-Government viſible, but what was Romiſh, for many ages: and our Antagoniſt M. <hi>Elmeſtone</hi> confeſſeth, that their Office of the Miniſtery (the principal pillar of the Church) came directly from <hi>Rome</hi> no longer ago then <hi>Luther</hi>'s time. Hereupon, that of Proteſtantiſm is not termed a Separation, but a Reformation; their Office and Memberſhip coming radically from the Romiſh Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue: which ſeems to be hinted by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Chap. 51.9. <hi>We would have healed Babylon, and ſhe was not healed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It hath been objected by others, <hi>What ſhall we think of the Greek Church, who never had to do with Rome, nor owned her power?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To whom we reply, 1. That the Church of <hi>Grecia</hi> may be no plea to ſuch who live in the <hi>Levant</hi> under the Turk; but concerns not in the leaſt our Proteſtant Churches, who derived not their power from the Greek, but from the Romiſh Pontificality.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not true, that the Greek Church never had to do with <hi>Rome.</hi> For about the yeer 390 after Chriſt, all the Eaſtern Biſhops yeelded the Primacie of ſeat (the proper place of Chriſt) to the Romane Pope. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, if the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> obtained by <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperour the title of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> then aſſuredly the Biſhop and Patriarch of <hi>Grecia</hi> muſt be ſubject unto him, and together with the Church be within the limits of his territories.</p>
            <p>Again, the Greek Empire was poſſeſſed by the Latines for ſixty yeers together, even from the yeer 1200 to the yeer 1260; and then <hi>Michael Paleologus</hi> recovered their Empire, who about the yeer 1273 agreed with Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the tenth at <hi>Iyons</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and promiſed that both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and all his people hereafter ſhould yeeld all Sovereignty to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Pope and Church.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:114948:16"/> 3. The Greek Church was as well National, and had a terrene Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, even the very ſame with <hi>Rome;</hi> and is ſo apoſtated, that ſhe denies the holy Ghoſt to proceed from the Father and the Son; prays for the dead; believes that the Saints departed enjoy not the preſence of God till the Reſurrection; admits children of ſeven yeers old to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe then (as they conceit) they begin to ſin; receives none in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Orders, but ſuch as are married; and forbids marriage to thoſe who are actually in Orders; rejects carved Images, but admits the painted; with many the like Fopperies; and in many fandamentals is as groſs or groſſer then <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, Chap. 7, all the four windes of all quarters were reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; Chap. 11.2, the whole outward court of Diſcipline, as well Eaſt as Weſt, was caſt out, as above; and the great City <hi>Babylon</hi> was not onely at <hi>Rome,</hi> but at <hi>Judea,</hi> where our Lord was ſlain, Chap. 11.8; and then certainly <hi>Grecia</hi> (lying in the midſt between) muſt needs be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the circumference thereof.</p>
            <p>It hath by ſome (as the Dippers) been queſtioned, whether theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Churches be within the Covenant.</p>
            <p>To whom I anſwer, that though in their Church-order they were <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> or confuſion, yet are they not wholly excluded from the Covenant, as Heathens, but are termed by the Spirit <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who had a ſealed number amongſt their tribes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. Here we may ſee how (though the place or hand failed) the name was everlaſting. And it is not ſafe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the words of this Prophecie, eſpecially ſeeing the ſequele hath cleared, that there was ſome profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and a godly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple amongſt them through every age of this hiding of Gods power. You may find this further cleared in the following Paragraph.</p>
            <p>The next thing conſiderable under this firſt Querie, is touching the true Church in this confuſion.
<list>
                  <item>1. What ſhe was.</item>
                  <item>2. What was her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. What ſhe was. In Chap. 7, I finde that there were one hundred and fourty four thouſand ſealed ones preſerved, ſecured, and provided for: In Chap. 9, that this number onely was undeſtroyed by the Locuſts: In Chap. 11, that the Temple meaſured muſt be this ſealed company, built up a ſpiritual houſe by the myſtical bond of the Spirit; it having no dimenſions ſpecified, and all the externality being excluded, as ſhall be proved in Paragraph 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. In Chap. 14.1, that the mount <hi>Sion</hi> there expreſſed muſt be onely the mount of true grace footed on the counſel of God, which is called a ſure and ſealed foundation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. All the ſealed elect people, even the whole one hundred and fourty four thouſand ſtand on this mountain, and that through all the apoſtated ſeaſon: which they did not do in any true viſible, being mixed amongſt the Nations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Onely they, and none elſe, had their ſtand thereon: all the reſt of the common Iſraelites were hurt by the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of the windes, Chap. 7. by the Locuſt, Chap. 9.3. and were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114948:17"/>ſupplanted by the Beaſt; Chap 13.8. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. Hence I deduced this conſequence, that the Elect alone muſt make up this Temple, Sion; and that all other Chriſtians that had but the externality (bring in a falſe viſibility) had not ſo much as outward meaſurement, but were wholly the patrimony of the Beaſt and Whore.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What was her condition here. In Chap. 7, that ſhe was ſome of every tribe diſtinguiſhed from the reſt onely by the ſeal of true election, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20, 21, 22. In Chap. 11.2, that all her outward court was taken from her, and it being excommunicated, became another, even the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Nations. In Chap. 12.6, 14, that ſhe (who, verſ. 1. in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive day was in heaven, there clothed with the ſun, had the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve ſtars, all ſeen in open type, as being enriched, beautified and completed with full power in her out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward viſibility;) afterward by this apoſtacie fled into the wilderneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath her former viſible orbs, where all about her was dry, barren, and confuſed earth: the Kingdom of God was during this time within, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.21. Her place, verſ. 6, 14. muſt be the aboveſaid Temple, void of the externality of Order. Alſo the call for ſeparation inters as much; as <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Return, return, O Shulamite:</hi> alſo, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 35.10, <hi>The ranſomed of the Lord ſhall return, and come to Sion:</hi> the word <hi>ranſomed</hi> imports their being captive before; and their <hi>return,</hi> their abſence from that <hi>Sion</hi> they come unto: alſo, Chap. 51.14, The captive exile haſteth to be delivered from the pit; which implies their former being in: again, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4, <hi>come out of her, my people,</hi> intimates that they were a company in <hi>Babylon</hi> before the time of this departure, even in that city which is called <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> Chap. 11.8. by which the Spirit would teach us, that as <hi>Lot</hi> was in outward <hi>Sodom, Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt, Judah</hi> in <hi>Babylon;</hi> ſo the Lords people ſhould be in ſuch a viſible conſtitution, as ſpiritually was <hi>Sodom</hi> for beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly idolatry, <hi>Egypt</hi> for bondage, <hi>Babylon,</hi> as being in a ſtrange land from the native <hi>Canaan</hi> of a Goſpel-Order, where they were ſtrangers under other lords.</p>
            <p>And in which Country there was another earth, ſea, rivers and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, ſun, throne, rive, <hi>viz. Euplwates,</hi> and air, Chap. 16. They cannot properly be called out to reward her in theſe, but they muſt be before within. In Chap. 11.3, 4, The Witneſſes (even thoſe who were the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt adminiſters of light to the Temple) had their outward clothing, not with the ſun as before, but with ſackcloth (their external inveſtment into Memberſhip and Office being Antichriſtian) and their ſtand before the earthly god of humane Hierarchies (even in the above-ſaid wilderneſs or great city, verſ. 8.) where the Beaſt, thoſe ſtrange earthly lords, have power to do, and trample them under foot with tyranny, verſ. 2. Chap. 13.5, making their eſtate mournful. And in this dark night of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, they were as thoſe aſleep, as not altogether ſenſible of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtate, till God by his call awaken them out of this drowzie Coma, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.5, 6.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:114948:17"/>
            <p> By theſe Scriptures me may gather, that this myſtical Church, or ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed number, was ſtript of all the glory of his viſible inheritance in Church-order; and outwardly in a falſe Babyloniſh ſtation, as in a foraigne country, under ſtrange Lords; where ſhe was in a mixed eſtate; partly hurt, defiled, and through blindneſs deluded; partly; untouched, undefiled, undeceived: they were indamaged, dimmed and ſeduced in the externality; but in the radix of the internal grace, could not be ſubverted, it being ſuſtatined by the immediate hand of heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The next remarkable thing is, How the Church was fed in this deſolation.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.1, 2. we may deduce, that there was ſome ſecret vertue of the Covenant to ſecure and perpetuate the ſealed company: In <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.1. that, as there were worſhippers in the temple, and an altar, ſo their worſhip muſt flow immediately from thoſe internal cloſets that were meaſured, and not at all from the outward court of order which was excluded: in <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. that Chriſt himſelf gave power to the witneſſes by an immediate gift, when there was none outward of office from man, and by that they fed the woman in her place, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.14. In <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.12. that though there were not ſeven pipes, a fulneſs of ordinances, as was in the primitive day, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. yet there were two remaining to empty out their golden oile, as before: that theſe muſt be ſuch ordinances as are promiſed in the word to continue, which is declared in this ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion above. Hence we may draw two obſervations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For the reſolving of a grand paradox propounded by the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copaliſts and Presbyterians againſt the ſeparation, <hi>viz.</hi> How there can be converſion in a falſe Church? Here we may take notice, that there was a temple within a woman, <hi>Sion,</hi> and a feeding by the witneſſes, where all the order was Babyloniſh.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that this more intrinſecal diſpenſation is weak and ſparing; and the Saints under it in a low and almoſt famiſhed condition, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.11, 12. Their ſtrength and perfection is then, when this more internal work dilates and ſpreads its vertue to the ſuperficies: therefore the way and journey of ſeparation is not a retiring in, but an outgoing both of Chriſt and his people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.12. <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.6. and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by the Lord Jeſus to a ſpring, <hi>Mal.</hi> 24.32, 33. as diffuſing its vital ſap more outwardly, and bloſſoming: that magnificent kingdome of the marriage is likened to a ſummer, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.29, 30, 31.</p>
            <p>The not obſerving this, nor marking what ordinances were left of God to be meerly formal, and what remained with ſome degree of power, hath occaſioned many to run into another extream; and draw the work of the Spirit ſo within its ſelf, as might ſtop all the expirations or out-breakings thereof: and under the notion of highneſs, bring men into a lower condition then that of the Antichriſtian ſtand: that was a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſparing breathing; theirs a ſtifling and ſuffocating of the Spirit,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114948:18"/>as obſtructing all its paſſages by which it ſhould reflow in its workings out.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The laſt conſideration is the time of this great deſertion and loſs, when it began, how long it abides, and the computation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>This time cannot begin with the firſt trumper, as Maſter <hi>Brightman</hi> and others carry it, but muſt receive its initiation with the fifth deciphered in <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It cannot be with any clearneſs of ſenſe begin, till the woman had taken her full flight into the wilderneſs, <hi>chap.</hi> 12.6. In the former trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets two parts in three of the viſibility remained true; and the ſtar in fifth was in heaven till he fell to the earth; and by that apoſtacie all the externality of church-policy became an earthy bottomleſs and Babylon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh wilderneſs. Now the woman could not be in the wilderneſs, while her officers were in heaven; but they muſt both fall together.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This mournful ſeaſon emphatically ſtiled by our Saviour the time of tribulation, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.24. muſt initiate with the firſt of thoſe three grand woes, ſounded by the Angel flying in the midſt of heaven; and that began with the fifth trumpt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.13.

               </note> Now to reckon up the period of this ſeaſon, if we add to 1260, the foregoing time of 390, we may finde the expiration thereof to be about 1650. Many arguments may be produced to prove theſe dayes to be prophetically a day for a yeer; but it hath been done by others; and moſt that are judicious, by pondering the hight and order of this prophecie, with the event ſucceſſively anſwering,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114948:18"/>will, <hi>proprio niſu,</hi> of their own voluntary conſent agree with me and them in this particular. What remarkable turnings and alterations of affaires there were about 1650 in all our dominions, even in theſe ends of the earth, with the ſubſequent ſucceſs, is ſhewed in Parag. 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond material paſſage to be expoſtulated is, what is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation now approved of God in this next revolution after the former ſeaſon of adverſity,<note place="margin">Quaere <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> whether by new erecting of viſible Churches, or by ſeparation without ſtating, waiting till the Lord begin it; or thus, whether the time for the return of viſible marriage be now or hereafter.</p>
            <p>For the reſolving of this Gorgian knot,<note place="margin">See Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ag. 4.</note> we may propoſe to our ſelves a twofold rule. Firſt, Whether there be a call to foot any Church-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution in our time, or in a time to come. Secondly, what is the next immediate cauſe to give vital being to the ſame.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the firſt, we obſerved, by ſearching the Scriptures, that every thing belonging to Church-order, either at its firſt riſe, or after a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, long and total loſs, was grounded on the written word of God, and manifeſted by the ſpirit of Prophecie: Surely the Lord will do nothing in this, but he reveales his ſecrets to his ſervants the Prophets, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.7. that the book of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> compiling in a certaine method the ſeveral changes and adminiſtrations time after time, muſt as well inform us when this manifeſt kingdom reverts, as it doth teach us when and how the primitive was diſſolved and became Babylon: and upon ſtrict inquiry, we could not eſpie the leaſt hint, either by type or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal expreſſion, for any approved viſible Church-marriage in the age we live in; but that the <hi>Revelations</hi> together with the old Prophets, agree with one accord, that the time for this noble work is to be fulfilled in an after-age.</p>
            <p>The ſignes to know this magnificent fabrick to be to come, are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The deſtruction of the Antichriſtian enemies and removing obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles out of the way, as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.18. <hi>The Lord will make a covenant for them with the creatures, and will breake the low, ſword and battel ou<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the earth, and make them to lie down in ſafety;</hi> and then <hi>verſe</hi> 19, 20, I will marry thee to me for ever: alſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.30, 43, the tares are firſt cut down, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wheat is gathered into the barn: ſo <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.18, 19. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.8, there is no viſible temple in heaven opened, till the were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed who deſtroyed the earth, even till the deſtruction of the great City mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.19. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. likewiſe <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.7, 8, 9. there is no marriage ſpecified, till the <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> be ſung for the finall ruine of Babylon, and the glorious reign of God Almighty: and then, (<hi>Zech.</hi> 14.9.) when the Lord only is king in all the earth, the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife prepared for her husband: then ſhe hath a new grant of his beautiful wedding-garments, whereby ſhe ſhall be outwardly<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa,</hi> 611, 10</note> covered with the robe of righteouſneſs, as a bridegroome
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114948:19"/>decketh himſelf with his ornaments, and a bride adorns her ſelf with her jewels: then is there a new call to the Marriage-ſupper of the Lamb.</p>
            <p>Thus we may note, that this illuſtrious prophecy given by Chriſt to ſhew to his ſervants future events, leads us as by a hand-dyal to the time when the primitive was caſt out, and to the very ſeaſon when it returns in its own ſupernatural luſtre.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next ſigne is the call of the Jews and thoſe Eaſtern parts; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.1, <hi>The Lord hath called the earth from the riſing of the ſun unto the going down thereof;</hi> and then <hi>God will ſhine out of Sion the perfection of beauty,</hi> verſ. 2. So <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.27, 28, when there is a true manifeſt ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering to the dead carcaſe Chriſt, noting a ſtating work, then he will manifeſt his ſhining diſpenſation from eaſt to weſt like lightning: and thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.12, 15, ſpeaking of the Jews, concludes, <hi>What ſhall their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving be but life from the dead?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The laſt ſigne is the viſible effuſion of the Spirit; which being more properly a cauſe then a ſigne, I ſhall refer the proof thereof to the Rule next enſuing. The final ſubverſion of-Antichriſt, the call of the Jews and the eaſtern parts, and the open pouring of the Spirit, are all as yet unaccompliſhed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next rule of Trial is, what gives life and preſent exiſtence to a viſible Goſpel-conſtitution and the keys thereof. Under this notion we examined the common received Maxime of all the leſſer independent bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which is this, That in times of Apoſtacie (as this of Antichriſtianiſm is) the keys of viſible Church-conſtitution, or Marriage-Ordinances, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve themſelves radically into believers, or into the power of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who may at any time take them up, erect and model viſible Churches, open and ſhut the doors thereof to others. This we reduced to the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of the primitive, and found that they prayed, preached, baptized, and at laſt brake bread while they were bare diſciples, and onely Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-members: but in reſpect of Church conſtitution, they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to tarry and wait at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> till the promiſe of the Father (to wit, the keys of the Kingdom) was given, whereby the Kingdom of God came with power, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4, 8. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.49. This was a manifeſt transfuſion of the Spirit, that did not onely increaſe the glory of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but alſo ſtated and inveſted them with new Memberſhip and Office, and inſpired the ſtative Ordinances of Ordination, Confirmation, Church-cenſures, with a new created efficacie, whereby they received in, and ſhut out of that new-married Church. The image of this is ſet forth in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. It is called a <hi>pouring out of the Spirit,</hi> in regard of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant meaſure thereof viſibly manifeſted, verſ. 17; alſo <hi>a mighty ruſhing winde</hi> filling the houſe, with <hi>cloven tongues of fire,</hi> verſ. 2, 3, as cauſing that breath of life and ſpiritual heat which operated in that apparent Kingdom: <hi>Iſaiah</hi> compares it to ſmoke filling the houſe, as preſenting the glory of Chriſt in his powerful adminiſtration, Chap. 6.3, 4. In <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.4, 5, the four Beaſts or livings with each of them four faces (which muſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114948:19"/>typifie the Apoſtles, Prophets, and Evangeliſts, who had all giſts and tongues, by which they were diſtinguiſhed from the four Beaſts <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.6, 7, who had each of them but one face) came out of the midſt of that winde, cloud, and fire: alſo in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8, 11, the Spirit tells us, that all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral degrees of the Miniſterial Office, to wit, together with the former three Paſtors and Teachers, were ingendered originally by that virtual efflux of the Spirit ſent down from heaven. Indeed the twelve were ſet apart for their Office by Chriſt while he was on earth, and in that ſenſe named Apoſtles (as <hi>Joſeph</hi> is called the husband of <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſhe his wife while they were no more then eſpouſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.18, 19, 20. and a man may be termed an heir, when he is onely deſigned for the inheritance) but their real inveſtment was not till after. For <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in the place before quoted ſhews, that the four-faced beaſts proceeded out of the wind, cloud and fire expreſſed, <hi>Acts</hi> 2; and in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4, Chriſt firſt aſcended, then gave gifts; the gift ſent down was the Office, <hi>Some Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. They had not till then that differential eminency of gift which gave being to, and diſtinguiſhed their Office from the reſt, nor of extraordinary Prophets or Evangeliſts, nor of ordinary Paſtors and Teachers; no, nor yet of the ſame which private members had after the Spirit was emitted. They were before unfurniſhed with the gift of Tongues, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.2, looked on Chriſt as an earthly king over a temporal kingdom, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.21; were ignorant of the death, reſurrection, and aſcenſion of Chriſt, the common and main principles of Chriſtianity, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.22. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.11, 13. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.11, 21, 25. were not able to bear many things, which after were eaſie to every believer, <hi>Job.</hi> 16.12. Chap. 14.26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. And this M. <hi>Robinſon</hi> and others, the ſolideſt men of the Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have maintained againſt the Presbyters and Biſhops.</p>
            <p>Again, their firſt deſignation came not from man, but onely from their Maſter; which makes leaſt for thoſe who here will plead againſt us. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the diſciples were not called a Church, nor did any lay on hands for Memberſhip or Office, nor uſe any Church-cenſures, till they receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed power from on high. Hence we may ſafely conclude, that Goſpel-ſtating at the firſt beginning, came not from believers as believers, but from the powerful diſpenſation of Chirſt Jeſus; and that when if ſunk and the ſame open windes before animating were with-held, it muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to him the fountain whence at firſt it flowed: for every thing reſolvs into its principle.</p>
            <p>But leaving the primitive, we may ſearch the Scriptures treating of this laſt marriage to come, and we ſhall find the ſame pouring of the Spirit, that was in that firſt Goſpel-day,<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.2 <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.7.</note> 
               <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.13, 14, 15. the joyous City ſhall lie deſolate, untill the Spirit be poured out from on High, whereby the Wilderneſs ſhall be a fruitfull field, and the fruitfull field counted for a Foreſt: alſo <hi>Zech.</hi> 17.10, I will pour upon the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and the inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Spirit of grace, &amp;c. Which muſt be on Jews and Gentiles; for the mourners here poured on, are interpreted
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114948:20"/>by our Saviour to be all the tribes of the earth, who by their ſins and Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dol-worſhip have pierced Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.30. likewiſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.9, th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame open windes (before bound up, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.1.) ſhall be then looſed in their manifeſt blaſt. So, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.24. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.4, there will be the like fiery flaſhing lightning to illuminate the world, which the earth ſhall ſee, to wit, viſibly, and tremble: alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.16, <hi>When the Lord ſhall build up Sion, he will appear in glory;</hi> and <hi>Iſai.</hi> 60.2, <hi>His glory ſhall be ſeen upon thee;</hi> both which places ſhew, that his moſt excellent diſpenſation ſhall be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Hence we may gather, that as this by the apoſtacy reſolved into Chriſt; ſo it muſt again iſſue forth from him, before it can have its true exiſtence. For this glorious effuſion of the Spirit in the firſt beginning of Church-conſtitution, is the foundation of the keys thereto pertaining; it gives them their vital being, their proper difference, and by its mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold work, cauſeth thoſe various operations which proceed from and by them. Thus in the primitive marriage, they received power from on high, whereby the Lord was to them for <hi>a crown of glory, and a diadem of beauty, Iſa.</hi> 28.5. by vertue whereof, they had the high keys of the Kingdom: So in this laſt, the Lord will firſt marry them to himſelf, to wit, pour out his Spirit upon them, whereby they ſhall be as a crown of glory, and a royal diademe in his hand, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.2; and then verſ. 5, they as ſons of the Church ſhall marry in others: the firſt is done by God immediately, wherein man is meerly paſſive; the ſecond by man, as inſtrumental, working by the power of his preceding. Into the firſt work of marriage acted ſimply by Gods own finger, none ſave the Elect enter: and not all the Elect; but onely ſuch elect ones who believe and wait for the ſame promiſe of pouring the Spirit: for ſuch choice ſingled ones were the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty in the primitive; though by the ſecond done by the hand of the Church, hypocrites did then intrude: So in this laſt matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27</note> none but the virgins who expect and prepare for this later coming of the Bridegroom by the pouring glory of his Spirit, ſhall go in with him to the Marriage; and not all they, but properly the wiſe virgins ſhall be thus immediately inveſted from heaven,<note n="*" place="margin">See Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.10: what may be afterwards by the ſons of the Church, we leave to the times to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.</p>
            <p>If you will bring all our new-ſtated Churches to this touch-ſtone, you may finde them to be of a different metal from the true; and however ſo neer the primitive they ſeem to be in the outward ſhell, yet in reality to be grounded upon another foundation, to wit, upon believers not poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſuch a power viſibly ſent down from heaven. Now that faith, or the profeſſion thereof, without ſuch a divine call and ſpiriting, cannot be a ground-work for ſtating Churches, I ſhall further prove by theſe following Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Faith muſt foot on a call, as done in obedience to the heavenly voice: but now there is no call for viſible Church-marriage, as is declared in our firſt Rule: and no call, no faith; nay it wanting that, muſt bottom up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114948:20"/>our own call, name and time; which is preſumptuous diſobedience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God having promiſed to ſpirit this again, faith muſt rely upon the ſame promiſe till fulfilled, and not upon its own power: the hundred and twenty were believers, and yet begun not any conſtitution by vertue of that, but waited till the keys were given.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Profeſſion alone can no more give life unto Ordinances from which the glory of God is departed, then it can infuſe a living ſoul into a dead carcaſe. It is God's ſole prerogative to create their breath of life, which he will do in his own ſeaſon, according to what he hath promiſed. Faith and profeſſion are but effects: and to attribute ſuch a cauſal vertue to them, is to confound and turn the cauſes upſide down, and to ſet the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the place of his Creator.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This pretended ſaith, void of the call and promiſe of God, and the vital influence of its prime original cauſe, is but a meer work, a bare crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-foundation, by far too weak to lay a Goſpel-fabrick upon; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but humane, muſt in divine things be bottomleſs: and whether the ſmoke or diſpenſation ariſing thence, be not then that of the bottomleſs pit, we leave it to wiſe men ſeriouſly to conſider. We are ſure that this is the proper diſtinguiſhing character, to difference the true from the falſe. The true begins with the ſmoke or winde, Gods glory inſpiring, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the keys, opening and entering; and by that it becomes a ſpiritual building: the falſe begins with the key, the ſmoke enſueth, and thence is it a building made with hands grounded on tradition, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.1, 2. The true is as ſmoak deſcending from heaven; the falſe as ſmoke aſcending from an humane bottom.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now ſpeak a little to you of the Separation, who are modeled into the form of ſtated Churches. I know there are many precious Saints amongſt you, in whom the character of Jeſus Chriſt is printed: and confeſs that ſome of you have been inſtruments to bring to light ſome ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Truths, and prepared way for greater. You hold a Separation from all National Hierarchies, according to the Scriptures; have in part clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Beaſt reacheth further then the Papal Chair of <hi>Rome;</hi> have renounced prelacies and precedencies; have vindicated the conſciences of the godly from the Laws and Canons of Courts and Claſſes; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Goſpel to come in the liberty and power of the Spirit; have rightly pleaded that members of true Goſpel-Churches muſt at leaſt have a viſible Saintſhip; have to this day been real and cordial in that noble Cauſe beginning in our ends of the earth. For theſe good things found amongſt you, I proteſt in the preſence of the great Tribunal, I am obliged by the bond of entire affection, and deſire your ſpiritual welfare, as my own ſalvation. Yet I muſt not, dare not flatter or diſſemble in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters divine; but becauſe I love, I am compelled to deal plainly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; reſting confident, that thoſe who are truely pious, will deſire to ſee their combuſtible works burn by the fiery trial of the Vials. What I ſhall expoſtulate with you, I have already convinced in my ſelf.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:114948:21"/>
            <p> Conſider ſeriouſly, whether conſultations be not weak grounds to bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom Goſpel-Churches; or whether the primitive (the patern you labour to model by) was ever laid upon ſuch ſandy foundations, or whether theſe your actings do not contradict many of your own tenents before named. Did the Kingdom of God in that firſt day come by obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or by the deſcending majeſty of the Spirit? Or will Chriſt (think you) be leſs glorious in this later Reformation, then in the former? View (I beſeech you) the Scriptures treating of the dignity of this later marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Or if you cannot ſearch primarily into the cauſe, look into the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects that follow theſe your undertakings. For knowledge in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way comes to us <hi>ſecundum poſterius;</hi> ſo that by thoſe ſignes or ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes which break out in manifeſtation, we are directed to look into the fountains whence they iſſue forth. Why was there ſo great efficacy in the outward order of the primitive Government, but becauſe it proceeded originally from the manifeſt blaſt of the Spirit? Why is there ſo little in your externalities, if not becauſe ariſing from weak humane principles? You that are moſt diſcerning, do you not ſee too much of formality, too little of power? Nay, why was that one and the ſame in every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, drawing the flock of Chriſt into a general unity, unleſs becauſe it footed in the Spirit, which by its illuminating glory, virtual operation, and perſwaſive attraction, congregated the whole body of <hi>Sions</hi> ſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it? Why are yours manifold, diſagreeing, and occaſions of dividing the Saints, but becauſe baſing on obſcure carnal apprehenſions? Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience informs us, that your various conſtitutions have rent the Lords people in pieces, and are as ſo many walls to keep them aſunder: and that which divides is carnal. Tell us, To which of you ſhall we joyn, to come to the general Aſſembly? Yea, to what form ſhall we come, and not in the very act of ſitting down ſequeſter our ſelves from the major part of the godly? By a narrow ſearch, you may finde your union to ground in diviſion, your gathering in ſcattering. View <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.5, 6, and compare them to your diviſions. <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> choſen veſſels, were like in their minority to fall into the ſame relapſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.4, <hi>Master, if thou wilt, let us build tabernacles:</hi> but alas, they knew not what they ſaid, underſtood not that Goſpel-tabernacles were not to be made with hands, but by the powerful diſpenſation of the Spirit. Much like to this do you: Let us build temples, let us erect Goſpel-Churches. Well, if you muſt needs be doing the proper work of your Maſter, obſerve what cenſure he gives of ſuch deſignes; <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.23, 24, 26. <hi>Iuke</hi> 17.20, 21, 22, 23. Mark rightly the ſecret chambers, their grounds, their ſignes, their forms, their artificial ſtructure, narrowneſs, ſecrecy, multiplicity, their walls by which they are parted from the wilderneſs, and one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet their conjunction in the whole, and tell me whom you can apply them. But alas, you are herein aſleep, and know not what you do, or ſpeak, or write; are ignorant how the Marriage muſt again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from heaven. The Lord awaken you, that you may go forth from
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114948:21"/>theſe narrow rooms in the unity of the Spirit, and the bond of peace, to meet the Bridegroom. Let not an over-weening affection to your own models, be any impediments: for Chriſt will caſhier all buildings of man, and break down the partition-walls by the light of his diſcoveries. It will therefore be your wiſdoms to deny your ſelves in your ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective intereſles, and count them as loſs and dung in compariſon of the riſing diſpenſation of the Lord Jeſus: eſpecially conſidering that humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in ſelf-denial is the high-way to honour in the School of Chriſt.</p>

               <head>Paragraph I.</head>
               <p>IN this place we laid down a diſtinction of Ordinances; that the firſt ſort (as Miniſtery, Prayer, Baptiſm, the Lords Supper, Profeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſpecified above in the Ceſſation) footed more immediately on our ſpiritual union and the Covenant of Grace: that the ſecond ſort (as Confirmation, Ordination, Excommunication, Admiſſion, Abſolution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) are baſed on Church-conſtitution, and are eſſential to Officials (or a Church ſtated with Officers:) The firſt ſort of theſe remained ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, the ſecond not.</p>
               <p>This note of ours was but a haſtie and overly work, as deſiring in ſome ſort to anſwer your requeſt for the preſent; but intended and offered a fuller explanation of our ſelves by word of mouth; or elſe, I ſhould have given you a more exact and better digeſted account: however, we ſhall reſolve thoſe many things you retort againſt it. The firſt whereof, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a gifted Miniſtery, we ſhall reply to in <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:114948:22"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Againſt this you firſt oppoſe, That <hi>to believe in Chriſt, profeſs him, and private prayer, are Duties, not Ordinances: and that Ordinances are ſolemn and publike means, which Chriſt hath appointed to communicate his grace unto us, and to perform ſolemn ſervice unto him, as publike preaching, adminiſtring the Sacraments, publike prayer,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. The word <hi>Ordinance</hi> may be taken, either 1. more largely, for whatever God hath ordained; as the ordinances of the heavens, meat drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and as limited to divine things, for what he hath therein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and decreed; and thus <hi>ordain</hi> and <hi>ordinance</hi> may be conjugates: or elſe 2. it is uſed more ſtrictly, for Miniſtery, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the later fence Faith and Profeſſion are not Ordinances; in the former, they are: for, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48, <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal life, believed:</hi> where faith being grounded on Gods Ordination, muſt be his Ordinance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We conceive private prayer to be an Ordinance in the ſtrict acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation of the word, as well as publike; it being that whereby we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſolemn ſervice unto God, and a means by which he communicates himſelf unto us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But, ſay you, <hi>It is a Duty, not an Ordinance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which we reply, that as it is a ſervice God requires us to perform unto him, ſo is it our duty, we being bound to yeeld him homage and obedience: and thus publike prayer, and the reſt acknowledged by you, are duties, as well as private prayer: but as it is an organical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument inſpired from above, and a means for our good, ſo is it an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>
               <p>Object. 3. You except againſt the word <hi>eſſential,</hi> and aver that <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances cannot be eſſential to Officials: for nothing can be eſſential but the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and form: the matter of an Officer is gifts, the form an orderly placing him into Office by ſuch as have ſower to do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is not true that nothing may be termed eſſential, but the matter amd form: for there are ſome properties flowing from the nature of theſe internal cauſes, that are inſeparably annexed to their fountains, without which the cauſes themſelves cannot subſiſt: and the ſame, though they are not the eſſence, yet may be, and are in terms of Art called eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By Officials we mean a viſible conſtituted Church completed with Officers: and ſuch a Church hath in it eſſentially the viſible Keys of Church-power and diſcipline; which your own words aſſert, in affirming, that the form of an Officer is his orderly placing him into Office by ſuch who have power to do it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Not onely the matter, but the whole being of the Office lieth in gifts: the matter is a generical and more common, the form a differential pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of gift, to give being to, and diſtinguiſh the Office: and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per gift may be adminiſtred either from Chriſt immediately in the firſt ſtating of Churches, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8, where the gift ſent down was the Office; or elſe mediately in a Church ſtated by the hand as an inſtrument, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. &amp; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:114948:22"/>
               <p> Object. <hi>Nothing can ſubſiſt wanting its eſſentials: but a Paſtor or Teacher may be l<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tted by ſickneſs or otherwiſe, that he cannot preach,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for many weeks together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Preaching and adminiſtring the Sacraments are not of the later, but the former ſort of Ordinance, the exerciſe whereof is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to an Officer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You here confound the faculty with the action: the action may ceaſe, and yet the faculty be eſſential and inſeparable. A man cannot ſubſiſt without the faculty of Laughter; yet when the action faileth, he ceaſeth not to be a man. So in Sleep the Senſes are bound up from their exerciſe, yet their habit remains entire. A Conſtable in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is a true Officer, when employed in his private affairs, and not doing the work of his Office: but without the power proper thereunto, he cannot be a Conſtable. So Official Paſtors or Teachers lay not down their Office when they are off from their Eccleſiaſtical miniſtration; but without the potential faculty thereof, they cannot be Officers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 4. You except further, <hi>that Ordinances are not grounded on our ſpiritual union.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> All true Ordinances are baſed on the union of the Spirit, which is their breath of life, and repreſents them unto us, as the lively appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Jeſus Chriſt. And this may be called ours, it being part of our inheritance: when the ſame Spirit is ſevered and departed from them, they remain as empty rudiments.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But many partake of the Ordinances, that have not, nor ever ſhall have union with Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe who do truely partake of the Ordinances, muſt in the participation thereof have union with the Spirit of grace; becauſe the ſame Spirit that is in the Ordinances, is in the Saints: But to ſuch as have in no kinde the workings of that Spirit, the Ordinances are both dead and empty, or rather a ſavour of death; not that they are ſo in themſelves, but by accident, becauſe of their ſpiritual blindneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. There may be a clear and bright light in the air, yet for want of light in the eye, a blinde man cannot ſee, nor enjoy the comfort thereof. Thus the miniſtery of Chriſts Goſpel was a light ſhining in darkneſs, but the darkneſs comprehended it not, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.5. the Goſpel was not void of light, nor the Ordinances, being as pipes to the Lamps in the diſpenſation of their luſtre; but the men wanted ſpiritual eyes to behold and embrace its beauty.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But the foundation of Ordinances is the inſtitution of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deny not the inſtitution of Chriſt to be the foundation of Ordinances; but withal affirm, that the next immediate principle, is the Spirit of grace proceeding from Jeſus Chriſt, which by its union gives them their life and ſoul. There may be an inſtitution before the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance hath its proper exiſtence: ſometimes the command (as made known to us by Scripture-record) may be a ratification of that which was in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114948:23"/>and practiſe before, as we can inſtance in both. However, if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution be perpetuated in the Word, then it continues, and the Spirit joyns conſtantly with it when exiſting: if not, then may the Spirit leave it, ſometimes always, ſometimes for a certain time determined.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>The later are grounded on the Covenant of grace, and ſo are the former; if by founded, you mean they are effects,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If they be effects, they muſt depend upon their cauſe as their baſe and principle:<note place="margin">Every cauſe is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> for, <hi>Omnis cauſa est principium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We deny not that the later are branches of this Covenant: but the former have a more neer relation and connexion therewith then the later: for the former were uſed while Chriſt was on the earth, before the keys of the later were given: alſo the elect in myſtical <hi>Babylon</hi> were Iſraelites, as thoſe within the Covenant, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.3, 4. and (having their election ſealed up) had ſome breathing and nouriſhment by the former of theſe Ordinances: but the viſible Order in which they ſtood, is by the Spirit termed a <hi>wilderneſs</hi> and <hi>Babylon;</hi> and the later Ordinances, coming from the falſe key of that Church, were bottomleſs and beſtial. In the like manner <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> had miniſtery, the Paſſeover, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before the Legal Marriage was contracted: likewiſe the ten apoſtated Tribes had Circumciſion, where the viſible ſtated Church was idolatrous. Thus the former being before and without the later, have a more immediate compliance with the Covenant; and the later with viſible orderly Church-conſtitution joyned thereto: the one declares a Covenant mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; the other, together with it, a viſible Church-conſtituted member.</p>
               <p>To your ſixth Objection, from <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.1, I ſhall hereafter anſwer in its proper place, in Sect. 2.</p>
               <p>Now we come to examine and remove your Objections brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Ceſſation; which we will divide into five Sections.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>Section <hi>1.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Our firſt was, that Miniſtery, Prayer, the Sacraments, Faith, with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, had the promiſe of the Word to uphold their ſucceſſive abiding. But the later, as Ordination, Confirmation, Church-cenſures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſaid promiſe, and ſo lie void and deſolate for a time, as is proved in the Ceſſation.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall return to your two firſt Objections in the third Section next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3. In the third, to prove the later ſort to endure ſucceſſively as well as the former, you bring <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13, 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To that of <hi>Eph.</hi> 4, we aſſent that all the Officers there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, were gifts ſent down from Chriſt, after his aſcenſion to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, verſ. 8.11; as alſo, that they were differentially diſtinguiſhed each from other, both in the Office, its adminiſtration, and operation, verſ. 7. and that all theſe together exceedingly furthered the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114948:23"/>and tended wonderfully to the edifying of the body of Chriſt, and the completing of the growth and ſtature of the Saints: But yet we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that this diſpenſation of Office continued not to the end of the world (as you would inſinuate:) for it reached no further then the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Apoſtolical times. For proof whereof, we ſhall render theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe all the Apoſtles were dead at the end of the firſt, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſecond Century; and in little time after, Evangeliſts and Prophets. You may from this place as well argue the conſtant abiding of Apoſtles, Prophets, and Evangeliſts, as of Paſtors and Teachers; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit here ſpeaks of a complete and full diſpenſation of Official Miniſtery, conſiſting of all theſe together, to bring this noble work to its perfection.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The whole primitive key of Office was loſt in the Romiſh defection, and returns not again till <hi>Babylon</hi> is deſtroyed. See the Ceſſation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If Office had lineally deſcended from the primitive, then muſt <hi>Rome</hi>'s Officers and her officiating be good and true; and ſo ſhe a true viſible Church in the deepeſt of her Apoſtacie, whom the Scripture, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to be <hi>Babylon,</hi> and caſt out from true meaſurement, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.2. Chap. 17.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If your ſence be right, then apoſtated <hi>Rome</hi> muſt be a continued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing growing Church, higher then it was when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, or the higheſt degree of the Apoſtolical Church. For the word <hi>until</hi> notes a continued act, and all the tenour of the verſes declares an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing growing ſtate; whereas <hi>Rome</hi> was not a riſing, but a falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, 2 <hi>Theſt.</hi> 23.4.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Becauſe Chriſt in the time of this backſliding, promiſeth a new gift, that implies the failing of the former, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The union of faith here ſpecified as the period of this time, cannot be applied to the reſurrection: for then we walk by ſenſe, not by faith, and enjoy the thing now onely beleft.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, Sir, (to give you the true ſence of this Text in reſpect of time) we conceive that this word <hi>until</hi> extends no further, then the end of the firſt, or beginning of the ſecond Century. For then when the book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> was given, the whole Scriptures were completed, and ſo the work of the Miniſtery made perfect: then was the higheſt riſe, fulneſs, and unity of faith: then was the ſcruple of Circumciſion in greateſt part, if not wholly removed, the Temple being deſtroyed, which in <hi>Paul</hi>'s time was the greateſt cauſe of rents: then was the primitive Church in her higheſt ſtature, being as the ſun in its full Meridian: then were all things here ſpoken of, fulfilled: then, and but till then, was a growing riſing time; and after that, was a gradual declining: from that time, Hereſies and Errors, the renters of union, crouded in apace, <hi>Euſeb. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>chap.</hi> 29. In little time after, the three higheſt ſpheres of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Office were wholly reſolved and expired; and that remaining of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114948:24"/>Paſtors and Teachers, grew in every ſucceſſion more corrupt; and ſo increaſed in pride and uſurpation, till at length the Angel totally apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from heaven to earth, loſt the true key of Office, and, inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, had the key of the bottomleſs pit, which brought a gloomy night on all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Your ſecond Scripture is 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13, 14, <hi>where</hi> (ſay you) <hi>is a ſtrait charge laid upon Timothy to keep that courſe of diſcipline preſcribed to him in that Epistle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This ſolemn command of the Apoſtle doth not comprehend the whole Epiſtle, but onely that immediately going before; which is, to <hi>fight the good fight of faith,</hi> in following after righteouſneſs, godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, love, patience, meekneſs, and avoiding covetouſneſs, thereby to obtain eternal life: and this is doctrinal, and to be obſerved till the laſt coming of Chriſt. Now that it is thus, is clear from the text; for the Spirit faith not, <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſ.,</hi> but <hi>[this]</hi> as pointing at that immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding; nor <hi>commandments</hi> in the plural (as reſpecting all the ſeveral precepts of the whole book) but <hi>commandment</hi> in the ſingular number, as reſpecting one. The Apoſtle in this Epiſtle gives other charges by the particle <hi>[theſe]</hi> in the plural number, as Chap. 4.11, <hi>[Theſe] things charge and command;</hi> and Chap. 5.21, having before given rules about diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, enjoyns him to do <hi>[theſe]</hi> things without partiality, and lay on hands ſuddenly on no man. The phraſe of abiding is not at all annexed to theſe former charges (they containing many things that failed) but onely to this later ſingled out by it ſelf; which (it well reviewed) will further clear up our aſſertion, and by a direct diameter contradict the ſence which you would force it to.</p>
                  <p>To your fourth Objection, from <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20, we ſhall reply to in the concluſion of this Paragraph.</p>

                  <p>Our ſecond is, that Miniſtery, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being perpetuated in the Word, have always the life and power of the ſame Word in ſome meaſure accompanying them, whereby to preſerve their vital being, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.1.3. But the later (wanting the ſame Word to uphold their abiding) had the winde of the Spirit with-held from them, whereby they became as a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe without a ſoul, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.1.</p>
                  <p>We are to obſerve, that the outward matter of Ordinances are in themſelves, either barren empty elements, or at moſt, external formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; a meer carcaſe, or void cask: 'tis the Name and power of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Spirit ſent from him, that is their internal and eſſential form: when the ſame Spirit of life deſerts them, they then remain as a dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is, when the ſoul is ſevered from it; or as an empty cabinet out of which the Jewel is taken. Now the former of theſe (anſwerable to the Prophecies) are experimentally found to have ſome degree of their vital
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114948:24"/>faculty ſubſiſting. There is the ſame light, power, and vertue, in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, Prayer, and Praiſings, that was in the primitive age, though not in the ſame degree: likewiſe for Baptiſm (the badge of the Covenant) there was ſome ſecret vertue in the Covenant, to beget and preſerve a ſealed company amongſt the Iſraelites, which there was not amongſt Turks and Heathens, <hi>quat<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nus ſic:</hi> alſo the Communion received upon the ground of our ſpiritual union with all the godly, may confer ſome influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of comfort and refreſhing flowing from the death of Chriſt. For as there was a myſtical relation of the ſcattered Saints, which knit them to Chriſt the head and one to another by a ſpiritual bond; ſo was there a myſtical communion and feeding together, with reſpect to the ſame inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable union.</p>
                  <p>But for the later, that are proper to a Church ſtated and inveſted with full power (though in the firſt Goſpel-day they held forth the glory and face of Jeſus Chriſt) yet afterwards, when the external Government was taken from Chriſt's ſhoulders, and placed upon Antichriſt (as it was generally in the hands of Popes, Patriarchs, and Archbiſhops thorowout the world, according to what was propheſied that it ſhould be given to the nations, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.2.) then was the winde of the Spirit withheld from breathing in them; then was the glory of God departed from them; ſince which time, they have been but as an empty ſhell, out of which the kernel of their ancient truth was taken: ſince then, the lively efficacie and power of Chriſt is not found to accompany them, wherever uſed.</p>
                  <p>Conſider them as they are in the Romiſh Church, who alone in all our Horizon can claim a ſucceſſion from the primitive, and where (becauſe your Office is derived from thence) you are inevitably driven to hold their true being to remain. What tender hearted Proteſtant (who holds the Pope to be Antichriſt) can cordially embrace, that his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or his Clergie, by laying on of hands, can confer a true ſpiritual gift? or that Chriſt accompanies their hand with ſo much glory, as to make it the prime key on earth to beget the truth of Memberſhip and Office? Who would not bluſh to imagine, that the Popes Excommunications or Bulls deliver over to Satan; and, by conſequence, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

All which powers ſhe muſt have, if the real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſs the keys of the Kingdom. For theſe can no more be ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the keys, while abiding true, then the ſoul from the body while a living organ. But if <hi>Rome</hi> be fundamentally a falſe Church (as ſhe is held to be by the Proteſtant party) and ſtript naked of that primitive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie in her external government; then what may be thought of you who deduce your intereſt from her by deſcent? Experience hath taught the Saints, that there was as little efficacy of the true Spirit, if not as

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. You cannot (I hope) think that the converſion or edification of any ſoul under the <hi>Romiſh</hi> defection, came from the Ordination, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, Admiſſion, Abſolution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Pope, or any of his Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy: nor hath the leaſt good, but rather hurt, come from theſe as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by the Biſhops or you; for they have been utterly empty of any true ſpiritual breathings, as before is cleared.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Gods ways of converſion are various; his Spirit worketh when, where, and how it pleaſeth: ſometimes he calleth from the womb, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. ſometimes by the godly converſation of the Saints, by their holy walk and ſeaſonable admonition, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Ruth</hi> 1.16, 17. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1. Thus godly men in our times, going into places where the Miniſtery hath been blinde and formal, were inſtruments to work on and enlighten others; and by this means many have been ſpiritualized in the Antichriſtian times. Sometimes the Lord may ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie great outward afflictions, and the ſence of hainous ſins, as he did to <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.12, 13. Sometimes by the ſight of a ſtrange and fearful accident ſtriking a terror on the man; as <hi>Waldus,</hi> the firſt founder of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> was, by ſeeing a man fall down dead before him; alſo a kinſman of mine was firſt wrought upon by ſeeing a Fire-drake fall down beſide him. Sometimes by a divine light or viſion; as <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 9.3. alſo, another precious Saint in our age, by his own acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to me and others. Sometimes by reading of the Scriptures, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. which many very godly men in our days have affirmed to be the means God hath uſed to turn them to himſelf. Sometimes by a powerful officiated Miniſtery, as in the Primitive times. Sometimes by a gifted Miniſtery, as ſhall be in the next place manifeſted; and this gifted Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, together with the reſt of the firſt ſort of Ordinances, as Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were the ordinary means to feed the woman in the wilderneſs.</p>
                  <p>The variety of Gods ways in this noble work of Converſion, is beyond the apprehenſion of any creature: and you much forget your ſelf, in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114948:25"/>tying it up onely to an Antichriſtian Office. By what means the one hundred and fourty four thouſand, and the ſtanders at the glaſſie ſea, were ſpiritually begotten and brought forth, we leave it to the Lord: ſure we are, they were not <hi>oborigines;</hi> their birth came not from the earth, nor from the earthly key of your Officials, but from a grace deſcending from heaven.</p>

Chap. 11.19, 20.1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.31. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10, 11; though then the chiefeſt glory thereof was adminiſtred by way of Office: but in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian ſeaſon, the true Miniſtery was managed by a gift ſubordinate to, and beneath that of a true Office: for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There was no Office in all the Weſt, but what was Romiſh, for many hundred yeers after the firſt fall: and that it is there falſe and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian, ſhall be declared in the next Section.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When all Office came from Antichriſt and his falſe key, then Chriſt himſelf (to provide food for his Elect) gave power to his two Witneſſes, not from the hand of a Popiſh Ordination, but from his own immediate gift, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3, <hi>I will give to my two Witneſſes, and they ſhall propheſie:</hi> their prophecie came from the immediate gift of Chriſt. This gift beginning at that time when the four open windes were held from their blaſt, and the falſe key was given muſt be a gift inferiour to the former Office, and come not from any mediate power on earth, but ſimply from heaven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Experience hath taught us in our generation, that there is not the leaſt degree of vertue in Ordination, that addes one ſcruple to the gift of the Miniſtery, or tends to the furtherance of ſalvation; but rather that the Spirit hath breathed forth with with greateſt efficacie, in ſuch men, who either had no Office at all, witneſs <hi>Dudly Venner</hi> of <hi>Cranebrook,</hi> M. <hi>George Frogmorton</hi> when he preached at <hi>Benn<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is not true; many neither were nor acted as Officers; many diſliked their Office, ſome renounced it, as is before declared: and if any did ſo act, and were acknowledged, it was the blindneſs of the times ſo to account, which the Lord in times of ignorance might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive at. Certain we are, that no good came from their Office, (that being falſe) but onely from their gifts: and the bleſſings thereof were weak and lowe, in compariſon of what they were in the primitive times, (they being darkned and bemudded by their Office.) And this is ſo far from being ungrateful, as that it is agreeable to the prophecies and the event.</p>

                  <p> Object. 3. <hi>Paul produceth the converſion of the Corinthians, not ſo much to prove his gifts, as for a ſeal of his Apostleſhip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We will firſt declare the occaſion of this argument of <hi>Paul,</hi> and then return to yours. The occaſion was this: There were certain falſe Apoſtles, who ſubtilly perſwaded the Churches (not that he was no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, but) that he was onely an ordinary Miniſter, or one at leaſt inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to an Apoſtle, and ſo not to be looked on as infallible. In conſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whom, <hi>Paul</hi> proves himſelf to be an Apoſtle in the ſtricteſt ſenſe; as is clear by this text, compared with Chap. 10.16. Chap. 12.12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1, 17, 18, 19. Chap. 2.7, 8.9. This premiſed, we ſhall now reply to your chiefeſt <hi>Helena.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. When Office was true, it had not onely an ordinary grace common with private Chriſtians, but alſo an addition of a grace and life proper to the Office. Thus Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, having ſeveral degrees of order, were endowed with a propriety of gift peculiar to each degree; and the ſucceſs was anſwerable in the heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> being a true Apoſtle, ſhewed forth all the ſignes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with Apoſtolical power and authority; and the ſame proper ſymboles accompanying his Miniſtery, and the peculiar effects thereof wrought in the manner of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> converſion, ſealed his Apoſtleſhip, and not their bare converſion; as is apparent by comparing this text with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12, <hi>The ſignes of an Apoſtle were ſeen amongſt you in all patience, in ſignes, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Bare converſion, without ſuch ſingular gifts and fruits, argues not any particular, no nor any Office at all. For men in every one of thoſe five degrees, nay ſuch as had no Office, were inſtruments in this honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deſigne; and a common effect proves not a particular cauſe. <hi>Paul</hi>'s argument had been weak and groundleſs, to demonſtrate himſelf to be an Apoſtle by ſuch a ſigne as was common to all other Officers, nay to private Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Witneſſes in myſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi> whether in <hi>Rome</hi> or elſewhere, received a gift from Chriſt tending to convert and edifie. Now the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion wrought by thoſe godly men, did not confirm the warrantable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of memberſhip and orders in the falſe Churches they lived in, (for their outward clothing was black deformed ſackcloth:) it onely evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced the truth of that inward grace and power given by Jeſus Chriſt. I hope you will not affirm, that thoſe good fruits iſſuing from the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of <hi>Sylveſter, Savanarola, Wickliff, Huſs, Luther,</hi> with others of the Romiſh Clergie, as alſo <hi>Latimer, Ridley, Hooper,</hi> with ſundry other Biſhops, ratified the Office of Friers, Monks, Prieſts, and Dioceſan Biſhops, as that of <hi>Paul</hi> did his Apoſtleſhip: we ſay, It ſealed onely their gifts.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall here ſift another argument of yours againſt this gifted Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, inſtanced in page 23 of your Book.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>If ſuch a gifted Miniſtery be currant, and ſufficiently authorized for adminiſtring Word and Sacraments, then there was no need of an Official
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114948:26"/>Miniſtery; and Chriſt, it ſeems, ordained therein a ſuperfluous Ordinance: for,</hi> Fruſtra fit per plura quod fieri poteſt per pauciora; <hi>It is a vain thing, and not beſeeming a wiſe man, to uſe many ways to do that, which may be done by ſewer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This your Philoſophical Maxime is not generally true in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but muſt admit of many limitations. For God is a free agent, and may work by more, or fewer, nay without mediums; and, in ſome ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, adminiſters a greater variety and fulneſs for ſatiety and delight, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9 1, 2, 3. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.9. in other times he uſeth a more ſparing diſpenſation, onely to maintain ſome being and life of grace.</p>
                  <p>When the Temple was deſtroyed, and the veſſels thereof lay void, and were of no uſe for Gods ſervice, in the palace of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> yet the Lord then was to them a little Sanctuary, in the truth of Grace, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You cannot from hence conclude, that the ſame Temple and veſſels as were made, conſecrated, and uſed in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> were ſuperfluous Ordinances; neither is it ſafe to charge Wiſdom it ſelf with vanity and indiſcretion, for effecting that by more, which he might have and did accompliſh by fewer means. So when the outward court of Church-government was given to the Nations, and in the poſſeſſion of Antichriſt, Chriſt did and might in point of honour and juſtice leave it, and diſtribute his grace by a more retired and inward way, as is at large declared in the Ceſſation. Therefore this your aſſertion is both untrue and dangerous, it intrenching upon the abſolute and unlimited Royalty of the great King.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>Laſtly, if the holding of the four windes be underſtood of the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit from breathing in Ordinances (for others carry it fairly in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſence) then,</hi> 1. <hi>there is nothing ſaid how long the reſtraint ſhould last, much leſs that it laſteth during the apoſtacie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That the winde metaphorically ſignifies the breathing of the Spirit, is apparent by theſe Scriptures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.2. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.9, 14. and it cannot here be fairly applied to any other ſence, it belonging to <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and the reſtraint being hurtful to their earth, ſea, and trees: that winde muſt needs be favourable and reviving, whoſe detaining is hurtful.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The text implicitely concludes the reſtraint to laſt during the time of the hurt, which is the whole Antichriſtian age: and after that, the four windes ſhall again be looſed, to animate what lay before ſpiritleſs, as is ſhewed on the ſecond Querie in the Ceſſation.</p>
                  <p>Object. 2. <hi>Then it muſt be meant of a more ſparing breathing in compariſon of the primitive times, not of an utter reſtraint.</hi> 3. <hi>If it be an utter reſtraint, then take notice that the reſtraint is general, and cannot by any circumſtance of the text be confined onely to Official preachers and preaching, but as fully reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the gifted men as to them; and ſo doth conclude an utter ceaſing of the Spirit now or then from breathing in or by any Ordinances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:114948:27"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To begin with the laſt of yours, 1. This withholding, and the hurt thereby, may be gathered by a circumſtance of the text not to be ſo general, as utterly to debar the Elect from ſome more ſecret and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inſpirations: for, verſ. 2, 3, the four Angels are forbidden to hurt by this reſtriction, till the Angel of the Eaſt had ſealed the ſervants of God in their foreheads: which infers a care, and ſome proviſion for the ſpiritual ſubſiſtence and breathings in, upon, and by the elect: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it reacheth not to the gifted men: for they had a power given immediately from Chriſt, which breathed forth in Miniſtery, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3; and as there was an inward Temple and Altar, ſo there was approved Worſhip therein, flowing from the truth of grace, verſ. 1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The reſtraint was total, in reſpect of outward Order and Church-conſtitution. For, firſt, Therein ſucceeded another key, alſo, that was caſt out, and became <hi>Babylon,</hi> as ſhall be ſhewed in the two next Sections: and the Spirit cannot breathe in that which is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupted, and becomes another, eſpecially in what it excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates. Secondly, The winde here expreſſed, was utterly detained from blowing on the earth, ſea, or any tree; which muſt imply it to be in ſome ſence general. Thirdly, All ſave the Elect were hurt thereby, and ſubverted, verſ. 2. which diſ-intereſſes other common Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites from thoſe outward priviledges they enjoyed while the viſibility was true.</p>
                  <p>From hence we gather, that the open windes deciphered <hi>Acts</hi> 2.2, which gave being to the external keys of Church-government, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together bound up from their manifeſt blaſt: but yet a ſtill and ſecret influence, coming more immediately from Jeſus Chriſt, which never was wanting from <hi>Adam</hi>'s time, remained: and this was more ſparing and narrow in compariſon of the primitive, both in its meaſure and degree, and the number of the Ordinances which it occupied.</p>
                  <p>The windes here kept back are ſaid to be four, in regard of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity thereof, reaching to the four quarters: alſo the windes of the earth, it being an adminiſtration more viſible here on earth: thus the power of binding and looſing by theſe more external keys, is ſaid to be on earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19. And as the natural windes bring a ſweet influence of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility to the earth, and of purification both to ſea and air, by their breathing in this lower Region, the reſtraint whereof cauſeth things to putrifie: ſo this ſpiritual winde, blowing here below on the Iſraelites earth, ſea, and trees, cauſed the ſpices thereof to flow out, and purified all, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.16: but after it was withheld, then enſued a common infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Chap. 8. Chap. 9. Chap. 13. Chap. 11. Chap. 17. which poyſoned all except the ſealed ones, who properly had ſome ſecret inhalations from the Angel of the Eaſt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Angels we conceive to be evil ſpirits working by their principal miniſters, the four capital Patriarchs of the Chriſtian world; to wit, the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> for the South, of <hi>Antioch</hi> for the Eaſt, of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:114948:27"/>for the North, and <hi>Rome</hi> for the Weſt; who (uſurping, and in a manner ingroſſing all Eccleſiaſtical Government into their hands, and tugging amongſt themſelves for Primacie) did by contention, pride, ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, and hereſie, gradually detain the four windes from breathing in the external Regiment, till at the laſt the Headſhip fell into <hi>Rome,</hi> where it became another. And this reſtraint was not properly in them, as if any creature had power over the holy Ghoſt; but by accident, in the ſame ſence that the infection of Nature is ſaid to reſiſt and quench the Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 7, 51. and 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.19.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe the Iſraelites here ſpoken of are thought by ſome to be the natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> I ſhall (for their ſatisfaction) evidence by ſome arguments that they muſt be the Chriſtian nations, or Gentile Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites; proved by theſe following Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> was not ſent to the Jews, but to the Gentiles, as principally belonging unto them; and, in various types, pourtrays the ſeveral changes that ſhould befall them, from the days of <hi>John,</hi> to the final conſummation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The main body of this Viſion, was after the days of <hi>John,</hi> as you may gather by Chap. 4.1; and for time begins when the open breathing of the Spirit was withheld, when the trumpets that brought in the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie were ſounded, when the outward court was caſt out, even when the Jews were almoſt utterly fallen away from any profeſſion of Chriſt, from whom onely comes ſalvation, and could not then have one hundred and fourty four thouſand ſealed ones amongſt their tribes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The four Angels ſtand upon all quarters of the earth; and the with-holding is univerſal, The four windes; and the hurt thereby to all the unſealed Iſraelites: which cannot agree with any one Nation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This hurt was chiefly introduced by the locuſt, Chap. 9.4. and by the Beaſt, which can in no ſence be applied to the Jews, but to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian nations, who were thus undermined by Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By comparing this text with Chap. 11.2, we may clearly perceive that the nations poſſeſſed the court without the temple, which was the ſtand of the common Iſraelites. The common Iſraelites ſtand in the court without; the nations ſtand in the court without: the nations then muſt be theſe common Iſraelites; eſpecially conſidering, that all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of this book are not proper, but allegorical.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The number ſealed from amongſt them, was the ſame not hurt by the Locuſts, Chap. 9.4, nor utterly deceived by the Beaſt, Chap. 13.8. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. the ſame ſtanding on mount <hi>Sion,</hi> Chap. 14.1; which due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pondered with all the circumſtances, can be reduced to no time or condition, but that of the Elect in <hi>Babylon.</hi> If the Romiſh and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian defection be not deciphered by theſe figures, and but the Jews onely, then is it altogether omitted in this Book; then muſt all from thence to the end of the <hi>Revelation</hi> be peculiar to the Jews; neither of which can any man of wiſdom aſſent to embrace.</p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:114948:28"/>
                  <p> The Spirit hath ſo interlaced this Chapter, from verſ. 1. to verſ. 9, with all the after-types expreſſing the ſtate of the time of the tribulation; and from verſ. 9. to the end, with the next revolution and condition of the harpers, as may ſufficiently remove ſuch trifling conjectures from the mindes of all who will obſerve the order of this Prophecie. Thus we ſhall leave the ſecond Section, and proceed to the third.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> Againſt this you alleadge, that <hi>the Pope got into his hands all the other Ordinances as well as theſe; as Prayer, Miniſtery, Baptiſm; and yet for ſubſtance they remained true: why then may not the later, as Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe you here require us, we will give our Reaſons together (though moſt have been elſewhere written) why the former continued, and not the later. Our Grounds why the former abode, ſhall be firſt in general, then in particular.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſons in general are theſe two.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The former being promiſed in the Word to remain, the Lord ſo ſuſtained them by his Word, as no creature could aboliſh them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe, as Chriſt fore-declared that there ſhould be a ſealed num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to make up a myſtical Church in <hi>Babylon;</hi> ſo he upheld the former, as being more neceſſary to maintain the being of grace, ſome means of ſalvation, and the badge of the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Now a few words for the former Ordinances with faith and profeſſion in particular.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe of Miniſtery, Prayer, and Praiſings, ariſe from a grace in the ſoul, faith in the heart, and a gift diſpenſed from Chriſt alone, even then when the outward government was rejected: now his Spirit could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be radically touched, as it works in the ſoul. Thus the deſires of grace in the minde, aſpiring and fuming up to the Father of ſpirits in the Ordinances of Prayer and Praiſings, could not be reſtrained, much leſs razed by the great Antichriſt. Likewiſe the gift of the Witneſſes prophecie, wrought in the inward man, with the adminiſtration thereof breathing out teaching, is ſo given, inſpired and ſuſtained by Jeſus Chriſt, as the Beaſt could never take it into his full poſſeſſion: it this had been poſſible, he would not have ſuffered them to turn his waters into blood miniſterially, and ſmite his earth with plagues, and that, not ſo oft as the Beaſt, but as they liſted, verſ. 6. The Biſhops with us in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114948:28"/>
                     <hi>England,</hi> when they had full command and juriſdiction in Eccleſiaſtical regiment, could by no means wholly withhold or corrupt the deſires and prayers of the Saints, nor ſo take this inward gift into their cuſtody, but that in deſpight of their malice it brake forth in one corner or other of the Land, to teſtifie the truth in ſome meaſure, and diſcloſe, nay cry down the corruptions of the times. Alſo faith in the heart, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereof ſhining forth in profeſſion, were beyond the ſphere of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. For the inward created principle in the ſoul, breaking forth in and by theſe means and Ordinances, the Spirit in and by the Word ſuſtaining its perpetuity, and Chriſt ſupporting the ſame, are all far above the reach of Antichriſt: had theſe been in the power of that deſtroyer, he would have utterly marred all the ſprings, yea the very fountain of grace. In the ſame manner the communion taken on the ground work of the ſpiritual union of all the godly wherever ſcattered, (when the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated was falſe) and Chriſt therein fed upon by faith, was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſubverted: for the myſtical relation betwixt Chriſt and the heart, and the godly with the godly, was beyond the compaſs of Popes, Biſhops, or any humane authority whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Alſo for Baptiſm, though the Antichriſtian Church was in her conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and order unmeaſured to truth, and therein <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet ſhe was not utterly ſhut out from the Covenant, but had the call of Iſraelites, had the Name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, put on them, with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grace to believe the Covenant, and an elect ſealed number in and amongſt their tribes; none of which properties can be attributed to thoſe wholly without. Though Antichriſt in ſome things infected the externa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this Ordinance, yet could he not fundamentally raze the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, nor utterly aboliſh the name of Chriſt from amongſt Chriſtians, nor make invalid the power of the Word perpetuating that name, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 56.5. In like ſort the ten apoſtated tribes were in their Church-order ſet up by <hi>Jeroboam</hi> radically falſe; and yet were Iſraelites, within the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and had the ſigne of Circumciſion. Thus alſo men excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated are excluded from Church-fellowſhip, but not from their Baptiſm, and the Covenant. Likewiſe Hereticks, who fell from the Church, were received again not by new Baptiſm, but by laying on of hands: <hi>Euſeb l.</hi> 7 <hi>cap.</hi> 2 &amp; 3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our Reaſons why the later ſort, as Ordination, Confirmation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> abode not, are theſe following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are not promiſed in the Word to continue, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 56.5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They wanting that promiſe, were forſaken by God when corrupted.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All the external Order became Antichriſtian, and ſo the Ordinances proper thereto muſt be beſtial: or elſe how could there have been a <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> wherein the ſealed number were captives?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Our laſt, taken from this text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9, is, that theſe were wholly reſolved into the Pope, to whom was given another key, with other ſmoke and Officers. Theſe being altogether external, and Chriſt leaving
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114948:29"/>them, Antichriſt might have and had abſolute power therein to make them bottomleſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Againſt this you aſſert, that <hi>though the Pope have another falſe key, yet withal he hath the keys of Chriſts diſcipline, in Ordination, Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, Suſpenſion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though the Pope uſurp the carcaſe of thoſe Ordinances that were Chriſts before, yet their true eſſential form, which makes them to be Chriſts, and true Office and Memberſhip, on which they depend, he and his whoriſh Church have not. For confirmation whereof, theſe grounds do naturally ariſe from the text.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt Reaſon is drawn from the nature of the Pope and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Hierarchies, verſ. 1. the Star or Angel fell from heaven (the orb in which he was fixed before) unto the earth, or wilderneſs, Chap. 12.6. a total apoſtacie from his former office and ſphere: and was not in the leaſt degree heavenly, but terrene, earthly, and meerly humane, or a wilde beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.1. and is numbered not to God, but to man, verſ. 18. It is a true Rule, <hi>Corruptio optimi eſt peſſima,</hi> The corruption of the beſt things is always worſt, and moſt contrary to its former goodneſs: Satan who was the nobleſt, is by his fall the baſeſt of creatures, and moſt unlike to an angel of light, which he was before he fell. So here that Angelical Office which ſhined as a fixed Star in the bright firmament of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive purity, holding forth the livelieſt glory of Chriſt for the perfecting of the Saints, being once apoſtated from his former ſphere, became not onely an humane Hierarchie, but a meer Antichriſt, as moſt oppoſite to Chriſt of any other;<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.3.</note> and the man of ſin, as that wherein the quinteſſence of evil and deceit is epitomized and grown to its perfect maturity; and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, one in office altogether without and beſides the Law, and likeſt to ſin it ſelf, which is termed <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.4. nay, he is the principal vicegerent of Satan on earth, to whom he commits his chiefeſt power,<note place="margin">Rev. 13.2.</note> throne, and authority, in the exerciſe whereof he is Abaddon or Apollyon,<note place="margin">Chap. 9.11</note> deſtruction it ſelf in the abſtract, recorded in the two moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Languages; and is moſt emphatically ſtiled by <hi>Paul, The ſon of perdition,</hi> being one who hath cauſed the greateſt ruine and deſolation; and is termed by <hi>John,</hi> the King of the bottomleſs pit. Thus we may ſee, that the Office of the Pope and his Hierarchy, is moſt corrupted of any thing elſe, being that wherein the being of Antichriſt doth ſubſiſt, who is not a particular perſon, but a corporation. And this Official Hierarchy being ſtript naked of its primitive truth, and becoming meerly Antichriſtian, cannot in the leaſt degree beget a lawful Office: for, <hi>N<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l dat quod non habet:</hi> If the fountain be polluted, how can the ſtreams be pure? <hi>None can bring a clean thing out of an unclean, not one,</hi> Job 14.3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Angel had another key different in nature from the former. And it is impoſſible the keys of the kingdom of heaven can ſubſiſt with the key of the bottomleſs pit, or the power of Jeſus Chriſt be united with the power of Satan. Contraries in their extremes cannot ſtand together, but the one muſt deſtroy the other.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:114948:29"/> 3. The Church opened by this key is a bottomleſs pit; bottomleſs, ſhe being void of the groundwork of Truth in her order; a pit or priſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a hell on earth, in which men are captivated, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.27. Chap. 9.18 <hi>Iſai.</hi> 51.14. Chap. 49.9. <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.11, 12. alſo a Church excommunicated of God, and <hi>Babylon,</hi> Rev. 11.2. Chap. 17.5. and ſo cannot in her conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have the keys of the kingdom of heaven: for the key muſt be of the ſame nature with the Church. Beſides, if Confirmation, Ordination, Excommunication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be true in <hi>Rome,</hi> then muſt that Romiſh Church into which by theſe keys ſhe enters, and out of which ſhe ſhuts, be a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven, and a <hi>Sion,</hi> and not a bottomleſs pit, and <hi>Babylon,</hi> which (we conceive) you will be aſhamed to affirm.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ſmoke or diſpenſation of this pit or falſe Church, is helliſh and diabolical, eclipſing and darkning the whole Horizon, verſ. 2. and how can the ſmoke or winde of Gods glory ſpiriting theſe Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and making them lightſome, dwell together with the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, falſe, and deluſive ſmoke of the bottomleſs pit? ſurely the Lord will not ſo much honour Antichriſt his greateſt adverſary. If the Pope have the true ſmoke or winde of the primitive Church, then what he bindes or looſes on earth, is bound or looſed in heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19. as is further cleared in the ſecond Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Officers coming from hence are locuſts, of a divers kinde from the true, they proceeding from another key, king, pit, and ſmoke. If Office had been true in <hi>Rome,</hi> then Memberſhip muſt be the like, for he can be no true Officer, that is not withal a Member: and if Office and Memberſhip be both right in that Catholike Synagogue, then muſt ſhe be a true Church, being radically right both in Miniſters and people.</p>
                  <p>Sir, have you exclaimed againſt <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>Babylon</hi> for ſo many yeers, and do you now by this argument prove her to be Sion? However, we may from this text obſerve, that as the pit is bottomleſs, ſo is the key, the ſmoke and the locuſts ariſing from it, and that fundamentally: ſo that your Ordination, Excommunication, Suſpenſion, coming from hence, cannot have any parcel of the keys of the kingdom of heaven, but muſt pertain to this bottomleſs key.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But</hi> (ſay you) <hi>theſe Ordinances may remain the Ordinances of Chriſt, though in wrong hands, and abuſed: as the Great ſeal of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is ſtill in the right and true ſeal, though in the hand of an uſurping Lord Keeper,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you ſhould prove theſe conſtitutive Ordinances to be Seals, yet in the Broad Seal there be two things requirable.
<list>
                        <item>1. The Power and Authority from whence the Seal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds.</item>
                        <item>2. The confirming of an act coming from that power by the Seal.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:114948:30"/>
                  <p> When the writing ſealed is derived from a lawful authority, then the Seal carries the name and majeſtie of that true and rightful power, which makes it a legal ratification: but if it iſſue forth from an uſurped Primacy, though the matter and print may be the ſame with the other, yet the act ſealed bears the ſubſtance of that uſurpation, which puts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other form upon it, and makes it illegitimate, nay treaſonable. So theſe Ordinances pertaining to Church-order, in the primitive times ariſing from Chriſt and his Spirit working in the Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the name and power of Chriſt, which made them true, as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the lively image of himſelf: but theſe coming from other uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lords, as Popes, Biſhops, or the like, receive the character of the ſame uſurpation, which changeth their eſſence, makes them unlawful, and to carry the image of the Beaſt. And your Office flowing from this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial and exorbitant key, muſt be falſe in its foundation. The Key, the Church, the Smoke is another, and thereof not Chriſt, but Antichriſt, the king of the bottomleſs pit.</p>
                  <p>We informed you how the truth of this was verified by the event; that there was no other Office, but that of the Locuſts kinde, even in <hi>Luther</hi>'s time, who himſelf was a Monk.</p>
                  <p>In oppoſition to this, you reckon up ſome Biſhops, Monks, Friers, Prieſts, or of ſome ſuch Popiſh Order, that for 1260 yeers ſtood up to witneſs the Truth, who were not locuſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe men whom you reckon up, with any other of the like ſort of godly men officiated by Antichriſt, had no other Office, but that of the locuſt-kinde. You your ſelf acknowledge the Officers called Monks, Friers, Prieſts, Abbots, Cardinals, and the Popiſh Clergie, to be of the ſeries of the locuſt, a little before in the ſame page of your book. And whatſoever excellencie and honour theſe men gained beyond others, aroſe ſimply from the gift of Jeſus Chriſt, not at all from their Popiſh function, that being but the defiled rags with which the ſame Witneſſes were clothed. No man not Popiſhly minded, can imagine that their Frierhood, Monkery, Prieſthood, or the like, could confer any dignity to their piety; or that theſe men thus gifted by the Lord Jeſus, did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute any eſteem to their Popiſh Orders. It is obſervable, that God ſhould rear up ſuch men who had no Office but what was meerly invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to be ſuch noble inſtruments to teſtifie in ſome degree the Truth: which may teach you, us, and all others, not to give any worth to ſuch difiled Offices, but onely to their qualifications, which unleſs ſanctified from heaven, they had been locuſts as well as the reſt of their Orders; and to conclude that this their grace, and the right to diſpenſe the ſame, came not from their officiating, but onely from the gift and grant of the Lord of life. So that herein we muſt diſtinguiſh their inward gift with its adminiſtration, from their outward inveſtment: the one, diſtilling from Chriſt, was radically true and holy; the other, coming from Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, was utterly falſe, and polluted.</p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:114948:30"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Object.</hi> You aſſert further, that <hi>Ockam, John of Gaunt, Dantes, John Wickliff, Jerome of Prague, Luther, were men that amongſt others made up the ſeries of the three Angels,</hi> Rev. 14. <hi>and yet lived in the Church of Rome, had their external calling from that Church, were of ſome of the Popiſh Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Bare ſaying is no proving, and <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> he ſaid ſo, will hardly paſs for currant amongſt men of judgement. We ſhall deny that the men you name, were of the rank of the three Angels ſpecified <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6, 8, 9. much leſs that they were called Angels by vertue of their Popiſh Office, which you would inſinuate. For they lived within the circuit of the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty yeers of tribulation, wherein they were mourners; and being (as you confeſs) men that lived in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that had their external calling from that Church, and of ſome of the Popiſh Orders, muſt be thoſe Witneſſes clothed in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3. Whereas theſe three Angels were of the rejoycing Harpers, who aroſe not till after the expiration of that ſorrowful time, were clothed in white Robes of joy and greater purity, and had gotten the victory over the Beaſt, his image, mark, name, and the number of his name, Chap. 7.9. Chap. 15.2. Again, neither the Miniſtery nor Writings of thoſe you mention, were ſo pure and full, as might be termed an <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Goſpel,</hi> which the firſt Angels miniſtery was, verſ. 6: neither did they, with the ſecond, verſ. 8, unmask the root of <hi>Myſterie Babylon,</hi> great part whereof was ſealed up from their underſtandings: neither did they diſcover the Beaſt, his image and mark, in its whole latitude, with the third, who with a thundering voice crieth againſt all ſuch defiled Offices with which they were outwardly arayed, verſ. 9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe miniſters or inſtruments of this threefold diſcovery, are not intitled Angels by vertue of any outward call to an Office by the Pope, Biſhops, or any other authority on earth; but onely by the priviledge of a gift diſpenſed immediately by the Angel of the Covenant, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.8, 9, 10, 11. Here their commiſſion or ſending forth <hi>[Go]</hi> comes ſimply from God; their furniſhing for this miniſtration, or their [taking and eating the book] from the Angel: and being thus divinely impowered, [they muſt propheſie] though all the earth oppoſe it: their engagement to propheſie ariſeth from their taking and eating the book. Beſides, the word <hi>Angel</hi> ſignifieth a Meſſenger, or one ſent with a prevailing admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; which may be either by the <hi>medium</hi> of a viſible power here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe; or elſe ſimply from above, without any ſuch <hi>mediums</hi> from man. All this we ſhall be ready to evidence in our next Return.</p>
                  <p>Before we paſs from hence, give us leave a little to go back, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the ground-work of your ſtand and dealings in this particular.</p>
                  <p>Truly, Sir, we conceive you are hardly driven, when (being ſounded to the bottom) you cannot juſtifie your own Office, but withal you are inforced to plead for that of Friers, Monks, Prieſts, Biſhops, and the whole rabble of the Popiſh Orders; nay, to maintain them to be the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114948:31"/>Angels of truth, by reaſon of their outward inveſtments from <hi>Rome:</hi> neither can you vindicate your intereſt in your key of Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Ordaining, Excommunicating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but you muſt therewith ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the Popes. Surely it is inevitable neceſſity drives you to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ſhift, that either you muſt hold the foundation of Church-order to remain in <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo make that mother of harlots to be radically the true ſpouſe; or elſe you muſt yeeld and renounce your own. We cannot but<note n="*" place="margin">Iſai. 29.9.</note> ſtay our ſelves, and wonder, that you who have been count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men of knowledge and godlineſs, ſhould ſo ſtraitly tie up all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Jeſus Chriſt to ſuch a corrupt and Antichriſtian function, as if you onely were thereby called and inrighted with a power to diſpenſe the ſame, when as your Office in the root thereof comes from the Pope (the angel of the bottomleſs pit) and his falſe way. If your eyes were opened to ſee the nature and extent of that key, you would quickly finde, that your glorying herein were your greateſt ſhame; and ſo it will appear ere long. For though you ſhould outwardly clothe this your Office, and the Church built thereon, with the faireſt Robes of the primitive patern, and could extract the quinteſſence of wit, policie, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, art, argument, to preſent it as impregnable, and had the tongues of men and angels, to paint it out with more then humane eloquence, to make it ſeem, like<note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 27.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Tyrus,</hi> to be of perfect beauty; yet (being in its principle earthly and bottomleſs) your Office, with the power of its go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, will unavoidably be diſcloſed to be a falſe Chriſt, a falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, or Beaſt; the Church ſuſtained thereby to be a daughter of that great mother, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. and her attire and ſeeming beauty to be no other then the glittering ornaments and paintings of the woman <hi>Babylon,</hi> the myſtery of whoſe deceit will be anatomized and made naked by the light of the Spirit. This lay concealed in times of ignorance, and God did more connive: but now his call enlightens and diſcovers theſe principles of deluſion, and invites to a ſeparation. Let us therefore adviſe you, in the bowels of charity, to obey this voice of the Spirit in coming off your ſelves, and to haſten your members the captive exuls, that they die not in the pit, that you may be of the number of the rejoycing harpers, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. and not of thoſe mourners, Chap. 18.</p>

                  <p>Our next ground was, that the viſible Church it ſelf (the foundation of theſe later Ordinances) failed; and ſo the Ordinances proper to a conſtituted Church muſt needs receive a loſs of their efficacie.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The inſtitution of Chriſt is a foundation; but yet that which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords preſent being or exiſtence, both to the conſtitution of viſible Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment it ſelf, and the Ordinances ariſing thence, is the Spirit of life
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114948:31"/>ſent from Jeſus Chriſt, as is elſewhere ſhewed. And whether ſuch a Church firſt married by God, whereby to have the keys of this viſible kingdom given them from above, and the Spirit of Chriſt united to and operating in them, enjoy not, by vertue of that union, a principle of power to uſe the ſame, and contribute a right Memberſhip and Office unto others, we leave it to you to conſider. The iron conjoyned to the fire, hath the ſame eſſence of heat and operation with the fire: and (I ſuppoſe) you will grant, that a true Presbytery coferring an Office un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another by Ordination, hath the being and foundation of that Office. This word <hi>foundation,</hi> taken <hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> ſimply and originally, is proper onely to Chriſt; but <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> after ſome ſort, may be attributed to the Church, whether viſibly corporated, or myſtical.</p>
                  <p>You aſſent, that <hi>if it be made good, that the viſibility of Church-order fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and became Babylon, it is enough to carry the cauſe.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is proved in the Ceſſation, from <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.2, that when this outward court was given to the Nations, it was then caſt out by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The words properly tranſlated, run thus: <hi>But the court which is without the temple, caſt out, and meaſure it not: for it is given to the Nations, and the holy city ſhall they tread under foot fourty and two months.</hi> When the Nations ingroſſed the externalitie and outſide of Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment into their hands, and joyned in with National worldly Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they made up national Churches. Here we may behold, as in a ſpiritual Map, of what nature they are, and how they are falſe and Antichriſtian in the original of their conſtitution, whether conſidered as Papal, Epiſcopal, or Presbyterial; which theſe Reaſons ſyllogiſtically drawn from the native ſence of the text, do demonſtrate.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thoſe Churches which are altogether outward, and have nothing of the temple and altar, and the vertue and life thereof in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, are meerly humane and ſpiritleſs.</p>
                  <p>But National Churches, whether Papal, Epiſcopal, or Presbyterial, are ſo:</p>
                  <p>Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Major you cannot deny: the Minor is cleared by the words of the text: for no more was given them, but the outward court. See Sect. 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe Church-Conſtitutions that are caſt out of God, are diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and forſaken of him.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch National Church-conſtitutions are caſt out of God: <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Major is undeniable: the Minor is confirmed by this Scripture: The court without, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which properly ſignifies <hi>caſt out,</hi> and not <hi>leave out,</hi> as it is tranſlated; hereupon enſued another key, Sect. 3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thoſe Churches that have no meaſurement by the line of Truth, are falſe and Antichriſtian.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch National Churches have no meaſurement by the line of Truth: <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The minor is evinced by the text, <hi>Meaſure it not;</hi> and ſo are bottomleſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:114948:32"/> 4. Thoſe Churches who are diſtinct and another from the holy City, are in their ground-work of their Order ſtrange and Babyloniſh. But ſuch National Churches are diſtinct and another from the holy city: <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Major is indubitable: The Minor is alſo evinced from the text, where [they] the Chriſtian nations, and the [holy city] are ſet in diſtinct and oppoſite terms.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thoſe Churches who tread the holy City, the ſealed number, under foot, are tyrannical and beſtial.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch National Churches do ſo tread; as is further aſſerted, <hi>And the holy city ſhall they tread under foot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The truth of this hath ſhewed it ſelf, not onely in the cruelty of <hi>Rome,</hi> but alſo by the like tyranny of the Biſhops in <hi>England,</hi> and the rigour of the Presbytery in <hi>Scotland:</hi> and that the ſame aſpiring ſpirit is in many amongſt you (if the ſword of the Magiſtrate would ſecond and impower you) the declarations of ſome, both in their writings, and in their open Pulpits (which men look upon as the oracles of Truth) have ſufficiently manifeſted to the world: we hope they will be more wiſe and tender of the conſciences of others for the future.</p>
                  <p>Theſe National Churches conſidered in one univerſal body, are the great city <hi>Babylon,</hi> Chap. 17.15, 18. Chap. 11.8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>Now if the viſibility of Church-conſtitution was onely National for many generations (as is cleared by all the evidences of former times) and theſe National Churches Babyloniſh, then muſt there be a fail and ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the truth of the ſame viſibility. Compare this Scripture with the event, and you may finde, that as here the whole outward court was given to the Nations, and then caſt out by the Spirit; ſo the event is parallel to the prophecie, which tells us, that the total Order of Eccleſiaſtical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment became National, and was for many hundred yeers Romiſh, in the full poſſeſſion of the Pope, where by the common grant of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants it is held to be <hi>Babylon:</hi> and when the viſible Church became a ſtranger, and bottomleſs, the key of outward Government, in Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, Ordination, Excommunication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt be of the ſame nature with the Church, as is declared in the former Paragraph.</p>
                  <p>The truth of this is likewiſe confirmed by the ſtate of the true Church in the times of this apoſtacie, who was onely a ſealed elect number, which by an inviſible union made up a myſtical temple, a Sion, a women, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whoſe viſible abode was in the wilderneſs of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as you may read in the Ceſſation. I ſhall here demonſtrate it by another Scripture, which was there omitted: The text is <hi>Micah.</hi> 4.10, where the prophet ſpeaking of the daughter of Sion, ſaith, that <hi>ſhe ſhall go forth out of the city</hi> (her genuine and celeſtial Order) <hi>and ſhall dwell in the field</hi> (anſwerable to the wilderneſs into which the woman fled, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.6.) <hi>and ſhall go even to Babylon</hi> (to ſuch a field where is meer confuſion;) from whence the Lord will at laſt deliver her by ſeparation, and redeem her from the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114948:32"/>hands of her enemies. And that this alludes to the condition of the Goſpel-Church in ſpiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> is evinced by the gathering of the nations againſt her, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11; which agrees whith theſe laſt combinations againſt the Saints, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54.15. <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.14, 16. by her horns of iron, and hoofs of braſs, to threſh and beat in pieces many people; alſo after her complete victory, by her conſecrating their gain to the Lord; which never was fulfilled in the majeſty here delivered, but muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the time of the vials, wherein the people coming out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> reward her and her aſſiſtants with the like degree of puniſhment, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.6. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.22.</p>
                  <p>The event doth likewiſe comply with this Scripture, as face anſwers to face in a glaſs. For the primitive Church, who was glorious in her viſible conſtitution, ſetled and beautified with Apoſtolical power, did after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline from thence into the vaſt barren field of the Babyloniſh nations, where ſhe was ſcattered here and there a godly perſon, outwardly mixed with the rude multitude, from whom ſhe was not diſtinguiſhed either in Memberſhip or Office, and where ſhe was held in chains of thraldom by Popes, Biſhops, and the like beaſtly Hierarchies, who in this ſtrange country monopolized the key of Government into their ſole tuition; and in this deſolate eſtate, ſhe muſt needs be an exile in a forraign land. From this bondage alſo the Lord begins at laſt to call her out, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her from her enemies. From hence we may neceſſarily conclude, that if this external ſtation wherein the daughter of Sion viſiby ſtood, was a field, a wilderneſs, a <hi>Babylon,</hi> or forraign country of ſtrange confuſion, then muſt all the beauty of her former outward Order be diſſolved, and turned into a rude Chaos: &amp; that if her key of viſible Rule was taken ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the uſurpation of Antichriſt the Beaſt, thoſe alien lords, Then muſt the Ordinances thereof lie void, as did the Temple-veſſels in the houſe of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s idol-gods.</p>
                  <p>We will now, with God's aſſiſtance, proceed to anſwer your Objections made againſt this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> You alleadge, that <hi>to ſay the viſible Church did fail, is as much as to affirm that the pillars of the earth were broken down, the Church ſtanding as firm, by Gods ordinance, power, and faithfulneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, that the pillars of the earth are born up by the Word of God, albeit the earthly governments thereof have the times of their ſhake and diſſolution, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.3. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2.19, 21. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.21. And withal, it is as true, that the Church in the being of election, inward grace, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion, and the more intrinſecal rule of grace, is a kingdom that cannot be ſhaken, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28, it being promiſed to be perpetual, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18.</p>
                  <p>But the viſibility of Church-government was not ſo pillared in the Word for its ſucceſſive abiding; this is rather fore-propheſied that it ſhould be corrupted by Antichriſt, and become <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To lay the ground-work of your after-diſcourſe, you here diſtinguiſh a viſible Church.</p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:114948:33"/>
                  <p> M. <hi>Elmeſt. Firſt,</hi> ſay you, <hi>by a viſible Church may be meant a company of Christians joyned together in one place, ſet in true order of Worſhip, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of all Gods Ordinances: that ſuch a Church hath been in any one place, or many ſucceſſively,</hi> (you think) <hi>cannot caſtly be proved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> By <hi>ſuch a Church</hi> (if we underſtand you aright) you mean a Church ſet in a right order of Diſcipline, and furniſhed with true Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. And if ſuch a Church cannot be proved to have been ſucceſſively through the apoſtacie, then muſt you yeeld that the primitive chain of Order was broken, and ſo juſtifie its ceſſation: for ſuch an one it is that you have maintained to abide, and we have proved to diſcontinue. This grant of yours duely pondered, doth at one breath unmount the whole fabrick of this your <hi>Babel;</hi> and might ſoon put a period to the major part of this Controverſie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M.</hi> Elmeſt. <hi>Secondly, by a viſible Church may be meant a company of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons profeſſing true religion, abſtaining from all falſe worſhip, and worſhipping God in a pure way, though for the most part in ſundry places, and meeting in ſmall companies: ſuch a Church hath been perpetual.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Such companies may thus aſſemble for Miniſtery, Prayer, (as did the one hundred &amp; twenty before they received powerfrom on high, and we do now) and yet not be a viſible Church inveſted with a full power to make Members and Officers. This ſtating of your caſe (if we miſapprehend you not) is a digreſſion from all your former and after writing, which tends to manage the continuance of a Church in memberſhip, office, and the keys thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such a Church as you here nominate, to wit, the Saints aſſembled in diſtinct companies, who were externally pure from all the corruptions of the times, cannot be ſhewn to the extant through the whole ſeaſon of the apoſtacie: for both the Scripture and the event hath manifeſted the contrary, that the true was here and there a godly man outwardly mixed with the common Iſraelites.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> You alleadge, <hi>Such a church there was in Iſrael among the ten apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtated tribes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. How that of the Iſraelites was through all the time of that defection, is uncertain: this we are ſure of, that there was then a true Church in <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was the common centre of Worſhip for all the Iſraelites: and it is more then probable, that the godly of <hi>Iſrael</hi> have had ſome relation to the Church of <hi>Judea,</hi> and went at times appointed to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But without all doubt, none of the Order of <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Prieſts were true Officers, nor any ſucceſſion derived from them: the like may be ſaid of the Pope, and of your inveſtment coming from him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is untrue, that there were always ſuch Aſſemblies: for in the days of <hi>Ahab, Elijah</hi> the chiefeſt Prophet knew of no ſuch congregatings, but teſtifies that he onely was left, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.18. So then the ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand reſerved muſt be a hidden number, known onely to the all-ſeeing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114948:33"/>eyes of Eternity, and not obvious in open Aſſemblies. Beſides, this pertains not to the Antichriſtian deluge, and doth not at all prove your point. Neither doth that of the Jews captivity: for they being amongſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and thoſe wholly without, did not involve themſelves into their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm, but were entire within themſelves in the ſervice of their God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in their own Synagogues, were diſtinct in their Genealogies from the Babylonians; their Prieſtly Office came not in the leaſt from the Idol-prieſts of <hi>Bell,</hi> but deſcended without any ſuch interception from the Order of <hi>Aaron:</hi> on the other ſide, the Saints in the myſtical were amongſt ſuch, who though in their Order <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet were not without the Covenant, but were Iſraelites, amongſt whom they were viſibly incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated, and not ſevered either in Memberſhip or Office, which your ſelf confeſſeth to be the condition of your firſt and choiceſt men, in the thirti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth page of your book. That of the Iſraelites, and this of outward <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> though in many regards it ſymbolizeth the Antichriſtian ſtand, yet not in all; there being ſomething more and proper to this later, which none of the former could chalenge.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But</hi> (ſay you) <hi>ſuch Aſſemblies there were through the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian defection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This we utterly deny, and have manifeſted the contrary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But to confirm the conſtant ſucceſſion of viſible Churches, you propound theſe Scriptures: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9.7. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.44. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We have aſſented to and proved, that there was faith, and ſome degree of its profeſſion viſible in the loweſt ebbe of Antichriſtianiſm: but it yet remains for you to evince, that the true viſible conſtituted Church had its perpetual abiding. Your text <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9.7, makes it good, that Chriſt ruleth in the kingdom of grace; but not a ſyllable of his conſtant reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in viſible Church-order is there ſpecified. We conclude thus far with you, that Chriſt ſits on this throne to order and eſtabliſh it with judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: yet his ordering is in its diſpenſations various: it was more open and full in the primitive glory, more retired and ſparing in the Babyloniſh deſertion, it will again be more manifeſt when the glory of the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns. The firſt word of the verſe is divers in the reading in the Hebrew copie, it being one thing in the line, and another in the margine;<note place="margin">The line is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </note> The line (if beginning with the primitive times) is moſt concordant with the other prophecies and the event: the margine (if applied to the Jews laſt return, and the kingdom then riſing) doth beſt agree with the other Scriptures ſpeaking of the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But</hi> (ſay you) <hi>what is this throne and kingdom of David, but Chriſt's viſible Church, in which Chriſt is to ſit and reign viſibly, as David did in his kingdom?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> You here confound the effect with its cauſe, in making this throne to be the viſible Church. <hi>David</hi>'s throne in a Goſpel-ſence, is the ſpiritual throne of grace, which is the centre of Divine Majeſtie, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fountain from whence all the influences of grace do flow, and that before which the Saints approach; and Chriſt ſits upon this throne of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114948:34"/>majeſty in the heavens, where neither he, nor his throne, are to be ſeen with bodily eyes, as <hi>David</hi> and his throne were, but are onely belieft by the piercing eyes of faith. Alſo the kingdom is but an effect ariſing from that incomprehenſible cauſe, not the cauſe it ſelf: and this may be more open or more hidden, according to the various adminiſtration of him that ſits upon the throne. Again, the throne of <hi>David</hi> was not viſible in the Babyloniſh captivity.</p>
                  <p>Your next text, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.44, belongs to the victorious kingdom of Chriſt in theſe laſt days, prevailing over Antichriſt, and the whole Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Monarchy. For, 1. This Image comprehends all the beauty and ſtrength of earthly Monarchs from <hi>Daniel</hi>'s days downward, the laſt whereof was the Romanes. 2. The laſt of Iron is diſtinct from the three foregoing of gold, ſilver, and braſs. Now, as the three former metals pictured out three ſeveral kingdoms, different both in their riſe, language and regiment from each other, to wit, the Babylonians, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, and the Grecians: ſo this laſt of Iron, being of a diſtinct metal from the other, muſt type out another Monarchy; even the next ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the former three preceding: hereupon the Spirit, verſ. 40, calls it a fourth kingdom: now the fourth from the Babylonians, and the next following the Grecians, was the Romanes, who were differing from the reſt, in their original, people, and government: The Romane Monarchy, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.23, is intitled the fourth kingdom. Furthermore, the ſtrength of the Iron exceeding, breaking in pieces, treading down, ſubduing all the reſt, and devouring the whole earth, can agree with no other but the Romanes. The Seleucians it cannot be: for that was but part of the Grecians, and is deſcribed to be one wing, one head, one horn of the third divided unto the four windes, and inferiour to the firſt riſe thereof, Chap. 7.6. Chap. 8.8. Chap. 11.4. Again, the ſtone interpreted to be the kingdom, not the king alone, breaks in pieces this of the Iron; and it was not the Saints of the moſt High, but the Heathen Romanes, that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the Seleucians. Now this fourth kingdom of the Romanes is daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ſhivers by the Stone, the Saints, in the time when this prophecie is fulfilled: and that it was not in the age of Chriſt's Incarnation: for then <hi>Augustus Caeſar</hi> reigned, under whom that Empire was in the higheſt degree of its glory and ſtrength. <hi>Florus</hi> reports of that time, <hi>Hic eſt Romani Imperii juven<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">

This they did not in the firſt Goſpel-day, when all the power of the Civil Rule was in the juriſdiction of thoſe Romanes, to whom the Church at that time was by the Ordinance of God ſubſervient. 4. This illuſtrious kingdom
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114948:34"/>thus filling the earth, is ſaid to be everlaſting, and ever to enjoy the ſame plenitude of regiment, verſ. 44. Chap 7.27. But even the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Government of the primitive, was ſeized on by Antichriſt and the Nations, who had all the outward court given them, and who trod the holy city under foot, in which time the Church had a great ſink and decreaſe.</p>
                  <p>Your next Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1 10.2, ſpeaks of the times of the vials, when the Iron rod of Chriſts ſtrength ſhall be ſent forth out of <hi>Sion</hi> to bruiſe his enemies: and then Chriſt in his ſeparated people rules as a conqueror over his adverſaries, who (though never ſo numerous) ſhall be brought in ſubjection, and ſuch as withſtand ſhall be broken in pieces. Hereupon the Spirit by the Kingly Prophet gives ſweet and ſeaſonable counſel, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. <hi>Be wiſe now therefore, O ye kings, be learned, ye judges of the earth: kiſs the Son, leſt he be angry,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>That we may avoid needleſs tautologies, we ſhall anſwer to the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt Chriſt and his Church, as he is a Head, a King, a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; and ſhe a Bodie, a Kingdom, a Wife: as alſo to your ſuppoſed inference of our bringing a notable alteration in Chriſt, in the fourth Paragraph, Sect. 6.</p>
                  <p>But here you bring three Reaſons why this relation muſt be viſible.</p>
                  <p>Object. 1. <hi>They are viſible things by which this relation is typed out, and ſo muſt point out a viſible</hi> (you mean a conſtituted) <hi>Church.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is uſual in Scripture to figure out matters myſtical and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, by things viſible and apparently known to us: that by objects na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and obvious to our ſenſes, our mindes may be raiſed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and comprehenſion of things divine and ſupernatural. Thus the relative dependence between Chriſt and a believer, is too too ſubtil and ſublimate to be beheld with bodily eyes: alſo Chriſt aſcended as the Head, the King, and Husband, and the throne of grace before which we make addreſs, though typed out by viſible ſubjects, yet are all to us invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: but the diſpenſation d<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>maning hence, is ſometimes more conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſometimes more internal, according to the pleaſure of Gods own working.</p>
                  <p>Object. 2. <hi>The Church inviſible, as ſo, is unknown, and wholly unſeen to men: and Chriſts inviſible rule cannot by men be diſcerned: and what honour were this to Chriſt, to reign onely inviſibly?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deny not that there was ſome degree of the profeſſion of faith always exiſting, but not a Church ſtated, and ſet in a true viſible order. Indeed your argument appears very plauſible to fleſh and blood, and makes moſt for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who onely in all the Weſtern world can chalenge a continued ſucceſſion of ſuch a viſibility: of which ſhe moſt boaſteth, and layeth as the chiefeſt pillar to bear up her Babyloniſh fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick. If then the glory of Chriſt cannot be uphold, unleſs it be carried on with ſuch an open regiment, this deformed Whore is either the onely beautiful Spouſe, or elſe could have no honour in the world. This Maxime of yours ſmells ſtrong of a carnal ſpirit, and tends to bring Chriſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114948:35"/>to <hi>Lo here,</hi> or <hi>Lo there;</hi> even in that time, when neither the firſt nor the laſt open days of the Son of man were to be ſeen, <hi>Luke,</hi> 17.22. If your eyes were further enlightned, you might diſcern, that the ſtrength of Chriſt is made perfect in weakneſs; and magnifies it ſelf as well in the loweſt eſtate of his Church, as in its higheſt exaltation, though more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed from his peoples apprehenſion. And thus the Lord is magnified, that though he ſuffered Antichriſt to uſurp all the external Order of Eccleſiaſtical Regiment, and make it a deſolate wilderneſs; yet in this earthly lowe ſtand of the Saints captivity, he reſerved to himſelf a ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed elect number, whom he upheld by his own immediate power and gift, againſt whom the gates of hell could not prevail; and will at laſt more abundantly manifeſt his power, juſtice, mercy, and love, in the deſtruction of this man of ſin, and returning to his people more outward magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence then ever they enjoyed before: it being the wiſdom of God, to make humility the way to honour, the darkeſt night of miſery, to bring in the brighteſt day of peace and happineſs. Again, when Antichriſt (as you confeſs) had ſeized on all the outward court of Order, it would have been no honour to the King of kings to dignifie this viſibility in the poſſeſſion of another, with the lively breathings of his Spirit, but rather very dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory for him to give his glory to another; and thereupon he caſt it out.</p>
                  <p>Object. 3. <hi>Where faith is, there it will be viſible.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Your ſelf holds that infants may have the being of faith, yet the manifeſtation thereof appears not unto us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.9, 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, 12, 13. but true it is, that when Chriſtians are of yeers, faith will ſhew it ſelf in the fruits of viſible profeſſion, in a godly and holy life, and exerciſe of the duties of Piety. 2. Viſible believers in the firſt initiation of viſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, cannot ſtate themſelves, but muſt firſt be ſtated by Chriſt, by the pouring out of his Spirit, as is at large cleared in the ſecond Querie of the Ceſſation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But to prove a viſible conſtituted Church through the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian times, you inſtance firſt the two Witneſſes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe Witneſſes are not viſible ſtated Churches, but ſuch men as held forth the light of Miniſtery for the feeding of the elect in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of <hi>Babylon.</hi> For, 1. They have a true relation onely to the hidden myſtical temple, without any reference to the outward court. 2. Their clothing, to wit, their outward inveſtment into memberſhip and office, was with ſackcloth, as is before ſpoken. The Primitive clothing was with the Sun, even when the Dragon raged againſt the woman in the height of cruel perſecution. 3. Their viſible ſtand was in the wilderneſs, Chap. 12.6, 14, and in the ſtreets of the great city where their bodies lay when ſlain, and on which earth they ſtood for ſome ſpace after the Spirit of life re-entered, verſ. 8, 11: and in this terrene ſtation they propheſied before or in the preſence of earthly Hierarchies, who ſate in the temple, or rather the court without, as God. The moſt of theſe Witneſſes were in the Romiſh Church, who cried againſt the known corruptions, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred ſpiritual food to the elect ſcattered in that confuſion.</p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:114948:35"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Object.</hi> It hath been frequently objected by others, that <hi>theſe are Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks, which never denote viſible Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Candleſticks are not always in Scripture figures of Churches, but ſometimes do ſignifie the veſſels holding forth the light of Miniſtery: in this ſence is it underſtood, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Mark</hi> 4.21. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.16. Chap. 11.33. where the light is the Miniſtery, the Candleſtick the organ or man containing that gift, the houſe with thoſe truely entering therein, the Church. And that it is ſo taken here, will plainly appear by an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite view of the text. For, 1. The Church is in this place delineated by another figure, <hi>viz.</hi> the Temple, verſ. 1, and not by the Candleſticks; and that houſe is alſo an inviſible temple ſhut up from the outward court, verſ. 2. 2. When Candleſticks do reſemble Churches, they are <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

They muſt here belong to Miniſtery, becauſe the Prophets themſelves who prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, are ſaid to be Candleſticks: whereas when the Candleſticks denote Churches, the Miniſters are pictured by another diſtinct figure, to wit, by ſtars, Chap. 1.16, 20. 4. Theſe are placed after the olive-trees, as drawing the oil therefrom: and the firſt relates to their qualifications, the laſt to their diſpenſation. The Prophets are called <hi>olive-trees</hi> and <hi>Candleſticks,</hi> as they are the inſtruments that bear, hold, and diſpenſe the grace and gift of prophecie.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>There were</hi> (ſay you) <hi>Saints ſo manifeſting themſelves, ſo diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Beaſt and whore, by their oppoſition which they made to their wayes, againſt whom the beaſt made war, overcame them, and were drunken in their bloods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Saints for many hundred yeers in the Weſt, even ſince the Apoſtacie, were not at all viſibly diſtinguiſhed from the Romiſh Church, but lived there without any open perſecution. Indeed within theſe later Centuries, God raiſed up more valiant champions, who upon ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, more manfully teſtified againſt the great Beaſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who was then onely extant known to be ſo; and diſcloſed further the corrupt doctrine of that grand-mother-whore; againſt whom that beaſt at laſt raged and prevailed by open perſecution. But the moſt of theſe alſo were here and there a man living and dying viſibly in that Church: witneſs the Martyrs here in <hi>England,</hi> which you may read in. M. <hi>Fox</hi> his book of Martyrs. If ſome were at laſt diſtinguiſhed from that great Whore, tell us what diſtinction of Office they had deſcending from the primitive Order, or upon what ground they were ſtated in Church-diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. Surely they living within the compaſs of the 1260 yeers, muſt be clothed with ſackcloth, and ſtand outwardly in that earthly confuſion, or wilderneſs, and ſome of late in the ſecret chambers. The ſaving and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt truths by them profeſſed were chiefly in point of doctrine. They unmasked onely the Beaſt and Whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> but were blinded in daughter-harlots ariſing then and after; and the Lord in times of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance over-looks the weakneſs of his ſincere ſervants. If the Lord had deſigned a continued chain of true viſible ſtated Churches (as you inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate)
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114948:36"/>through every age of this defection ſevered and apart from <hi>Rome,</hi> then, without doubt, he would have reſerved a ſucceſſion of office pure amongſt the ſaid Churches: nay, if there had been true offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Miniſters all along in thoſe Churches, then no queſtion but ſuch a lineal deſcent is extant, whence the outward function of the Miniſtery ſhould be deduced without being beholding to the key of <hi>Rome.</hi> But we know not of any inveſtment coming from Chriſt and his Apoſtles with us, but what is derived from the Popiſh Clergy; and you in effect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs as much in the 30 Page of your book, that <hi>Luther</hi> and your choiceſt men had their external calling thence: and ſo much muſt you grant of your own, unleſs you renounce your genealogy. Now if the key, pit and ſmoke in <hi>Rome</hi> became bottomleſs, as it did, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. then no off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring iſſuing from her can be grounded in the truth of order. Therefore were there the like beaſts in the Churches you plead for, who perſecuted the godly by ſword, baniſhment, impriſonment, blood, when they were anatomized, as the Pope their forefather did before.</p>
                  <p>We now come further to expoſtulate about the temple and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward court.<note place="margin">Rev. 11.1, 2.</note> Maſter <hi>Elmeſtone</hi> holds the temple to be a true viſible ſtated Church; and the Court without to ſymbolize ſuch a falſe Church ſtate, which never was bottomed in the truth.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, we maintaine the temple to decipher the myſtical union of the one hundred and fourty four thouſand ſealed or elect ones, whereby they are built up a ſpiritual houſe: and the Court without to be the externality of Eccleſiaſtical order, which was eſtabliſhed by Chriſt in the primitive times, and true; but after being corrupted by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, was rejected by the Spirit, and falſe.</p>
                  <p>Object. You alledge, <hi>That the temple is the viſible, becauſe meaſured.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This meaſurement was not in the viſibility of Church-order, but only in the inward work of true grace, and worſhip thence ariſing; as will appear by theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe when the viſible Church is meaſured, it hath alwayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of outward demenſions and diſtances ſpecified in the meaſuring; as of the new Jeruſalem the city was found by the golden rod to be ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand furlongs, the wals one hundred fourty four cubits, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.15, 16, 17. alſo <hi>Ezekiels</hi> temple and City, from Chap. 40. to the end of the book: whereas this hath no ſuch demenſions ſpecified in the meting.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the outward court (which we have proved in the Ceſſation to be the externality of Church-order) was excluded, and forbidden by the spirit to be meaſured; which muſt infer that nothing was here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, but the inward roomes of the hidden man, with worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> flowing from thoſe intimate ſprings of grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe only the ſealed elect number remained, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.3, &amp;c. Chap. 9.4. Chap. 14.1. Chap. 13.8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>Thoſe ſealed ones were</hi> (as you truly ſay) <hi>elect ſaved ones; but in all ages many more have made profeſſion then the elect: and ſo during the Apoſtacy many beſide the ſealed ones did help to make up a viſible Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:114948:36"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> In a true ſtated Church, hypocrites may be circumſcribed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of a true external ſtand, and ſo may have an outward mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurement: but when the exteriour order is excluded, and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurement only internal to the elect, who are viſible in falſe ſtands (as here they are in <hi>Babylon</hi>) then ſuch who have only an outward ſtation, muſt be wholly ſhut out, they ſtanding ſolely in the outward court of falſe conſtitutions. And therefore here all the world of <hi>Iſraelites</hi> worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the beaſt, except thoſe whoſe names were written in the book of life of the Lamb, ſlaine from the foundation of the world, Chap. 13.8. and Chap. 17.8. none are excepted, but thoſe who were written in this book from the foundation of the world. So that here, all ſave the elect are excluded, and that for one thouſand two hundred and ſixty yeers, Chap. 14.1, which razeth your next argument from its ſandy foundation. Their ſealing notes their confirmation of the truth of grace: and that being in their foreheads, argues ſome meaſure of viſible profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall in the laſt place deliver Maſter <hi>Elmeſtons</hi> aſſertion touching the outward court, which he affirmed in a verbal diſpute, which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner; <hi>That it typed out the ſtate of a falſe Church, and that it never had any meaſurement at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which was then anſwered, That it did prefigure the outward order, or viſibility of Church-conſtitution; and three reaſons were produced to prove it, drawn from the text, which you may finde written in the Ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; alſo, that this was true till here rejected by the Lord Jeſus, and could not denote that which never had any approved meaſurement, as was then likewiſe cleared by theſe following arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By way of alluſion to the temple of old: That as there was not only a Temple within, whereinto the Prieſts and none but they might enter, but alſo a Court without erected by Divine inſtitution, and ſanctified by the Spirit, into which the Prieſts and people had acceſs in common; both which made a full and compleat temple: ſo in the primitive times there was the internality of true grace, wherein proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the elect (who only were a royal Prieſt-hood) had intereſt; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe an outward order built up, and breathed into by divine inſpiration, into which Chriſtians viſibly profeſſing (ſome true, and ſome ſeeming) came: and both theſe together concurred to make a full viſible Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the words of the text, the court without caſt out, which the original phraſe <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſignifies: Nothing in propriety of ſpeech can be ſaid to be caſt out, that was not before within: <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> before he was excluded; none can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, unleſs he be firſt a brother; ſo this being now caſt out, argues it to be till then approved.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From the reaſon rendered by the Spirit why it was excluded [for it is given to the nations] which implies that it had meaſurement till it was thus given, and corrupted by Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p>Some trifling objections were made by Maſter <hi>Elmeſtone</hi> againſt theſe, which (partly for brevity ſake, &amp; partly becauſe I conceive them not to be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:114948:37"/>materiall) I ſhall now omit. If he think them to be otherwiſe, and be pleaſed to publiſh them, I ſhall be ready (with Gods aſſiſtance) to give a reply. Thus much of the fourth Section: we ſhall now paſs on to the fifth.</p>

                  <p>For the clearer apprehending of this Scripture, it may be requiſite, firſt to explaine ſomething on the Chapter, and after to declare your miſtakes thereon.</p>
                  <p>To begin with the unfolding of the Chapter, we are to conſider, there were three queſtions demanded by Chriſts Diſciples, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, <hi>When theſe things ſhall be,</hi> to wit, the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and diſſolution of the temple ſpoken of in verſ. 2.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, <hi>What ſhall be the ſignes of his coming;</hi> that is, of his bright miniſterial coming, and diſpenſing his ſpirit-like lightning.</p>
                  <p>The third, <hi>The ſignes of the end of the world,</hi> to wit, of the great and laſt day of judgement, and the general reſurrection. To which the Lord methodically, and in order one after another anſwereth, with the ſignes thereof, from verſ. the 15. to verſ. the 32. To the firſt, from verſ. 15. to verſ. 23. To the ſecond, from verſ. 23. to verſ. 30. To the third, verſ. 30, 31. To omit the firſt as that impertinent to this ſubject, we ſhall begin with the ſecond, of his coming like lightning.</p>
                  <p>The ſignes of the ſecond are double.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The long foregoing deluſion of Antichriſtianiſme, abiding till his bright coming, from verſ.23, to verſ. 27.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſhort noted immediate ſignals, as the darkning of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and the ſhaking of the powers of heaven, verſ. 29.</p>
                  <p>If you deſire to underſtand what theſe figurative ſpeeches mean, you may know by theſe places, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34.4. <hi>Joel</hi> 3.15. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.21, 22. and by the ſubverſion of outward <hi>Babylon</hi> ſet forth by the like metaphors, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13. 10. Alſo by the overthrow of the Jewiſh Church, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.30, 31. And that of the <hi>Roman</hi> Heathen Emperors, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.12, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>The ſignes preceding the third, to wit, the end of the world, are alſo twofold.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The appearing of the Son of man in heaven, that is, his bright coming like lightning.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The mourning of all the tribes of the earth upon the ſight of the ſame glorious diſpenſation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.4. <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. of the Jews for their long blindneſs in Judaiſme, of the falſe ſtated Churches amongſt Chriſtians for their defilements in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtianſme, of Turks and Heathens for their Mahometiſme and groſs Idolatry.</p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:114948:37"/>
                  <p> Againe, we are to mind, that the long Babyloniſh deluſion, of the ſigne of the ſecond, contains two diſtinct ſeaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The time of the tribulation of the godly, by the overſwaying po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the falſe Antichriſtian Churches; which by comparing this with the <hi>Revelations,</hi> continued 1260 years, chap. 11.2, 3. chap. 12.6, 14. chap. 13.5; a remarkable time, it being ingraven in five places of that prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, for our more eſpiciall remembrance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The time of the Sun and Moons darkning, the Stars falling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to wit, the ſeaſon of the vials wrath, wherein the Saints are paſſing from their former bondage, and retaliate the reward upon their Enemies, <hi>verſ.</hi> 29; where it is ſaid, Immediately after the tribulation, to wit, that wrought by the Beaſts prevailing for 1260 years: the word after, notes our another diſtinct time of the Sun and Moons darkning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Saints lifting up their heads; who at this time are ſaid to come out of great tribulation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14; and to get victorie over the Beaſt, <hi>cha.</hi> 15.2.: and that this deluſion continues the ſame ſeaſon alſo, is clear from <hi>Mark</hi> 13.24, where it is ſaid, In thoſe daies (to wit, of the Antichriſtian deceit) after the tribulation.</p>
                  <p>This orderly method of the text concurring with the Diſciples three queſtions, the agreement of the Apocalypſe therewith, and the ſucceſſion of the times ſo directly anſwering, may lead us to conclude, that this notable deceit belongs to that of the great Babyloniſh apoſtacie: yet for the further clearing up this truth, we ſhall evidence it by theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Becauſe Chriſt markes this out to be the next after <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: and the next grand deceiveable evill alteration ſucceeding to the Church, was that of Antichriſtianiſm.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 This ominous falſity is evidenced by the Spirit in <hi>Luke</hi> 17.22, 23, to be after the primitive, when he ſaith <hi>The daies will come;</hi> and withall, that the time when they ſhall ſay, See here, and ſee there, is the time of an inviſible day, as is further aſſerted, They ſhall deſire to ſee one of the daies of the Son of man (to wit, either that of the primitive, or the latter of his bright coming) and ſhall not ſee it: which moſt aptly agrees with that dark gloomie night of Antichriſtianiſm, when the Sun and Air were darkened, the day of Chriſts power diſappeared, and the Beaſt had power to prevail, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.1 chap. 7.1. chap. 13.5.</p>

                  <p n="6">6 Chriſt gives a principal and general forewarning, the danger being ſo great, which muſt relate to a notable and epidemical deceit, as was that of the beaſt,: this admonition took its effect by the miniſtery of the third Angel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.9, &amp;c. who rouzed the godly out of their former ſleep.

                  <p>We ſhall in the next come more nearly to the expoſition of the text, in which our Meſſias lively emblemes the ſtate of falſe Churches, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſubſtance of this deceit doth lye: and there we may at once take a ſurvey,
<list>
                        <item>1 Of their marks.</item>
                        <item>2 Of their grounds.</item>
                        <item>3 Of their formes, or rather their Spheres in which they inhabit.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 The marks of theſe falſ Churches are four.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Their viſibilitie in their ſtative order, Lo, or ſea, in that time when the true Kingdom was within, not to be ſeen in ſuch an open diſpenſation, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.21, 22.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The phraſe Here and there notes out a manifeſt place of reſt, or ſitting down, fitly repreſenting Church-conſtitutions: it is the character of the woman Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon in this ſeaſon to ſit as a Queen.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Their variety, here, and there, which muſt ſcatter, whereas the true is uniforme, and univerſally gathers the Eagles unto it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The viſible Loe or modell is firſt, and then Chriſt is brought to it, <hi>Lor here is Chriſt,</hi> as if the Spirit of life, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine primitive power were in it, when it is but their owne ſpirit, even that of Antichriſt aſcending from an humane bottom: hereupon, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.20, implicitely tells us that it ariſeth from humane obſervation of ſuch and ſuch a forme drawne from their imaginarie platformes, and forcing Chriſt unto it: whereas in the true Chriſt the dead carcaſe is there firſt, who inſpires it by the flaſhing lightning glorie of his Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The grounds are twofold.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 A falſe Chriſt, Antichriſt, or a Beaſt, are perſons uſurping that power which is proper and eſſential to Chriſt onely; and this they aſſume and uſe in conſtituting viſible Churches: hereupon they are ſaid to come in Chriſts name, <hi>viz.</hi> with his power and authority in pretence, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, (when in realitie it is but their owne name, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.43.) ſaying, I am Chriſt, that is, taking up ſuch a power as peculiarly belongs to him, whoſe ſole prerogative it is to begin viſible conſtitutions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.16. <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.6, 10. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19, 20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 A falſe Prophet is the teaching and managing of the ſame falſe power, as exerciſing in Miniſtery all the power of the firſt Beaſt or falſe Chriſt, before him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.21.</p>
                  <p>Both theſe concur to the making and compleating of falſe Churches: the moſt ſublime myſtery, and quinteſſence of whoſe deceit
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114948:38"/>lieth in their ſignes and wonders, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. which in <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.13, is to make fire to come downe from Heaven in the ſight of men; to wit, their pretending of the fierie operation of the Spirit to be in their ſtative or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, with ſuch a ſhew of working like unto God his working, as if it were Chriſts true fire coming down from Heaven, when indeed it is but <hi>ignis culinaris,</hi> or rather <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> a ſtrange feigned fire of their owne kindling; and <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. he had power to give life to the Image of the Beaſt by his ſpiriting theſe ſtative ordinances, which when true, are the image of Chriſt; when falſe, the image of a Beaſt: all which they ſo ſet in the face of men, as if it were celeſtiall, and the lively brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things of the Spirit: and this kinde of ſpirituall magick, may be fitly termed ſignes and wonders, that do the more univerſally ſeduce, becauſe they ſeem to be heavenly, and to be derived from Apoſtolicall power.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The formes or ſpheres of theſe falſe Churches are pictured out by a double figure; the Wilderneſs, and the ſecret chambers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The Wilderneſs. This is not a proper, but a metaphorical Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (as the Sun, Moon, Stars, and the powers of heaven are, and ſo are the lightning, the dead carcaſe, and Eagles) and pictures out a viſible ſtation reſembling a deſart; which moſt congruouſly complies with that of National Churches, whether Romiſh, Epiſcopal, or Presbyterial. Hence the woman, when once ſhe declined into a National ſtand, is ſaid to flie from Heaven into the Wilderneſs, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12:6. Hence is ſhe ſaid to go out of the City to dwell in the field of this Babylon, <hi>Mica.</hi> 4.10. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the great ſtrumpet was ſeen of <hi>John</hi> in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.3, thereby ſhewing that her place and reſidence ſhould be in the like earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuſion: for <hi>John</hi> beheld her ſitting in that deſart upon her ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let-coloured Beaſt, who by his name and ſimilitude is a Beaſt of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart, or wild beaſt, <hi>chap.</hi> 13.1, 2. Alſo outward Babylon alluding to the myſtical, is ſaid to be built for them that dwel in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23.13. The Sword of the Nations is called the Sword of the Wilderneſs, <hi>Lament.</hi> 5.9. and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſcattered amongſt theſe Babyloniſh people, is ſaid to be planted in the Wilderneſs, in a dry thirſty and land, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 19.13. in which confuſion, at laſt after ſeventy years ſhe found favour, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.2. So that in a ſpiritual ſence, that which is barren, earthly, and confuſed, is figuratively named a Wilderneſs.</p>
                  <p>But to return to our ſubject, we will ſhew you how fitly this type of the wilderneſs ſymbolizeth the aboveſaid national Churches. That as the wilderneſs is a low terrene place, in compariſon of the heavenly orbs; ſo are theſe, if balanced with the high celeſtial glory of the primitive: as that is open and vaſt; ſo are theſe wide, ſpacious and open for all of the nation, good and bad, to enter: as that is a dry thirſty ground, and barren of true natural fertility; ſo are theſe of ſpiritual: as that is full of thorns, brambles, heath, fruitleſs trees; ſo are theſe of ſuch men whoſe end is to be burned, and of many ſuperſtitious inventions: as that is a confuſed rough place, where men may loſe themſelves; ſo are theſe a Chaos, or Babylon, wherein millions of ſouls have been loſt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114948:39"/>eternally: as that is termed a houling wilderneſs, full of wolves and ſuch like wild beaſts, who tear, devour and kill; ſo are theſe of ſuch beaſts that have the mouths of Lyons, the paws of Bears, the inticing cruelty of the Leopard, with ſwarms of Locuſts; who though they come in ſheeps clothing, yet inwardly, are ravening wolves. The true Church in this confuſion is as a Lilly, not in the garden, but amongſt thorns; and Chriſt to his as an aple-tree, not in the orchard, but amongſt the trees of the wood. And though theſe be ſomething differing in their forms, yet, as national, all make up one great City; and have all ſuch hierarchies as concur in the ſame root: and they have all the marks and grounds before declared.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond Character is that of the ſecret Chambers, which are not outward, but myſtical, or more ſecret retired Church-models reſembling theſe Chambers. The Spirit could not take up a more exact ſymbol to figure out our leſſer ſtated bodies, then this of the ſecret Chambers.</p>
                  <p>For beſides, that they foot upon man, and have all the marks and grounds above expreſſed, they concur in all points with this type. That as the Chambers are ſet in figure after the wilderneſs; ſo did theſe ariſe for time after national Churches, even in the latter and declining age of the Antichriſtian kingdome: as they are ſevered from the open face of the deſert; ſo are theſe ſequeſtred from the national opacity: as they are ſmal compared with the vaſt wilderneſs; ſo theſe are but little cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations if conſidered with the former: as they are a more curious ſtructure then the rude Chaos of the other; ſo theſe ſeem to be more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly buildings then the national: as they notwithſtanding are only framed by the skil and wiſdome of man; ſo theſe pertaining to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rejected court, and being not grounded on the pouring out of the Spirit, muſt be a building made with hands, a meer humane architect: as they are Chambers in the plural number, many; ſo are theſe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, being erected anſwerable to the ſeveral and diſcording <hi>Idaea's</hi> of the artificers: as Chambers are ſevered from the open aire, and parted one from another by wals; ſo theſe divide themſelves by their diſſenting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, not only from the nations, but one from one another, as by ſo many bars of partition: as they are built up and cloſed in by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective walls, that a man within cannot get fairly out, unleſs the door be opened; ſo theſe are kept retired by their ſtatings, and by types and covenants ſo walled in, that one entered, can hardly get out without ſome pretence of perjury, if not excommunication, unleſs the door of their conſent be granted: as they are ſecret; ſo theſe are outwardly more reſerved, and myſtically concealed under a more ſpecious ſhew of holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſimilitude to the primitive patern; and are thereby more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be diſcloſed; howbeit, being but dark imaginary Chambers of their own invention, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.12. they cannot in theſe ſecret rooms be hid from the diſcovery of truth, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 23.24. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.22. as the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are firſt built, and then Chriſt is forced into them; ſo every one of theſe <hi>diviſim</hi> firſt bring, and then incloſe Chriſt within the narrow limits
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114948:39"/>of their own private corporations, to which they in a peculiar manner tye up all the promiſes. The Chambers are not ſituate in a heavenly ſphere, but in the foreſaid earthly wilderneſs, though their parvitude, ſecrecy, reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red cloſures, their exquiſite artifice ſeem to allude to ſuch conſtitutions as conſiſt of more choice and culled-out men, and are more methodically framed, and neerer to their firſt patern then the former. Thus we may take notice that theſe two metaphors of the wilderneſs, and ſecret cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſo lively type out falſe ſtated Churches, as he that runs may read it, and admire the wiſdom of the Lord Jeſus, who contracted the perfect image of ſo large a ſubject, into ſuch a compendious platforme.</p>
                  <p>Having thus explained our ſenſe upon the text, we ſhall now give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to your exceptions againſt it. Ours to you was thus. Satans ſubtilty was deep and deceivable in all ages; but the chiefeſt ſtrength of his art and policy was combined in making up the man of ſin: all deceivable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of unrighteouſneſs, the whole myſtery of iniquity is in him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, who being now by the glorious beam of truth, clearly diſcovered in the Romaniſt, Epiſcopacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be a falſe Chriſt in the wilderneſs, hath ſince entered into his ſecret Chambers, where he ſeemingly puts on a more curious dreſs of holineſs and purity, neerly reſembling the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-garment of the primitive Church; that thereby he might the more effectually deceive (if it were poſſible) the very elect.</p>
                  <p>Object. Againſt this you oppoſe, <hi>That this place in</hi> Matthew <hi>belongs not to the Roman Antichriſt, but is meant of ſuch who take on them to be Chriſt in perſon, as did</hi> Benchocab <hi>amongſt the Jews, and</hi> Hacket <hi>with his company in</hi> England.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe were falſe Chriſts or Antichriſts, who in pretence were for Chriſt (they coming in his name) and yet in reality were againſt him, as is before declared: neither was any that took on them to be Chriſt in perſon, ſo ſubtil and prevalent in falſe ſignes and wonders, as to indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the elect, and ſubvert all Chriſtians beſides; nor did any ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue through all the times of the Apoſtacy till the day of Chriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing like lightning, nor did they bring ſuch a general and long tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, out of which the godly at laſt do come, nor doth the figure of the wilderneſs and ſecret Chambers fitly allude to thoſe who took on them to be Chriſt in Perſon; but all theſe properties with the reſt above ſpecified moſt exactly concur with the great Antichriſt, whether Romiſh, Epiſcopal, or elſewhere, and none but in him. As for <hi>Bencocab,</hi> he was a Jew, and ſeduced none but Moſaical Jews, who ſoon found him (as you confeſs) to be an impoſtor, and therefore called him <hi>Bencosban,</hi> the ſon of a lye: his deceit was to the Jews only, of ſhort continuance, and did not at all indanger Chriſtians, much leſs the elect amongſt them. As for <hi>Hacket,</hi> he was an obſcure man, and did not involve <hi>England,</hi> much leſs the Chriſtian world in his private error, which was not known of moſt; or if it had, was too too groſs to delude ſo univerſally. The ſpecial warning of Chriſt to beware, infers a greater and more myſtical ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then were <hi>Bencocabs,</hi> or <hi>Hackets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:114948:40"/>
                  <p> Object. <hi>But</hi> (ſay you) <hi>this falſe one in the wilderneſs, cannot be applyed, much leſs appropriated to the Roman Antichriſt, who hath not acted his part in a deſart, but hath ſet as God in the Temple of God,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.4. <hi>and ruled with pompe over nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We did not appropriate him to the Pope, but granted the Biſhops and national Presbyters alſo to have an intereſt in him, who mingled all together, compleat this falſe Chriſt in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This wilderneſs is not a proper (as you carnally apprehend) but metaphorical ſpeech, and alludes to ſuch a way as reſembles a deſart, which is cleared above.</p>
                  <p>Now though ſuch worldly pompe may appear very majeſtical to fleſh and blood, yet in the Spirits judgement, and in a myſtical ſence, it is a deſolation, being barren and voide of ſpiritual fruitfulneſs. Thus outward <hi>Babylon</hi> was the glory of kingdoms, the golden city, anc very magnificent in the eyes of natural reaſon; yet together with her nations is called a wilderneſs, as before. So <hi>Rome</hi> the head and mother of this myſtical Babel is (as you aſſert) to a carnal judgement a great and ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly City, and ruled over multitudes of people; yet together with her nations, compared with the primitive heavenly glory of Chriſtianity, is a meer deſart: as ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.10. Sion is become a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. That Church which in the firſt Goſpel-day was Sion in the beauty of apoſtolical order, afterwards having ſuch a deſolation and confuſion of her firſt Goſpel-order, ſo great a famine of the word of God, ſo many thornes and briars in her, and uſurping a terrene national hierarchy, with multitude of ravenous devouring beaſts, together with a pompous ſhew of humane Ceremonies, Canons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might moſt fitly be ſtiled an earthly wilderneſs, ſhe being worldly in her foundation and whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice. The place in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4. in which Antichriſt ſits, is called the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by a Synecdoche, the whole for the part, to wit, for the outward Court: for no more was given to the Nations over whom he rules as God, then the outward Court, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.2. but the temple, verſ. 1. within, to wit, the inward roomes of the hidden man, that beaſt never reigned over, it being ſuſtained by Chriſt: and this you muſt aſſent to, unleſs you make <hi>Rome</hi> to be a true Church, and to have true meaſurement: this text of the Apocalypſe, interprets that of <hi>Paul:</hi> and the ſame outward Court was by the Antichriſtian impietie made a wilderneſs.</p>
                  <p>You grant, <hi>That the Browniſt, Dippers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>invite into ſecret chambers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If ſo, then ſurely it is very improbable, that Chriſt ſhould paſs over in utter ſilence the great beaſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> the head of all the reſt, which for many ages did ſo univerſally deceive the world; and hint only upon the laſt, and leaſt. It is not ſafe to tax Wiſdome it ſelf with ſuch an overſight, not to cloſe up your eyes againſt the light of ſo clear a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie.</p>
                  <p>You further inquire, <hi>Whether the calling of men into houſes, parlors, and Chambers, do not reflect,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:114948:40"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe Chambers are not proper, but figurative Chambers, as before is ſhewed: and preaching and praying in houſes, are not, as bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, theſe falſe narrow roomes: for the Apoſtles went about from houſe to houſe; and Chriſt hath promiſed his Spirit to thoſe who truly worſhip him in any place whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>You tell me, That <hi>mutato nomine, de me fabula narratur:</hi> the fable may be told of me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If any can tax me with falſe doctrine, or touch us in out call for or walke in ſeparation, let him come forth: we do not bring Chriſt to any particular ſtating, ſo to ſay, Lo, nor bottom our union on a narrow corporation; but ſeparating from all theſe reſtraints, we bear up our ſpiritual relation with all the godly wherever ſcattered, and indeavour to bring them off from theſe beſtial formalities which bondage the Saints, and divide Chriſt to Lo here, &amp; Lo there; that renouncing theſe, they may joyn together with one conſent in the way of ſeparation, wherein Chriſt is gone forth, that ſo they may get full victory over the beaſt; and this is not to bring into, but pull men off from their inthralings either in the wilderneſs, or ſecret Chambers. I will not ſay, <hi>Fabula de te narratur,</hi> as making the oracle of Truth to be an old wives fable, which your inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt me is: but whether for you to take up a new power to ſtate Churches, and to make members and officers, upon your own call, name, time, ſpiriting, and to ſhew ſuch ſignes and wonders in inſpiring you ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Ordinances, ſome whereof are meer inventions; for you, I ſay, to begin ſuch a narrow, limited, obſcure and unwarrantable work upon your own obſervation as a falſe Chriſt, and teach it up as a falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, be not numbered amongſt theſe ſecret Chambers, we leave it for wiſe and impartial men to determine.</p>
                  <p>You indeed plead for national Churches, and are officiated from their hierarchies, being in your confeſſion in the wilderneſs; but in your walk as thoſe in the narrow roomes.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="conclusion">
                  <head>Concluſion.</head>
                  <p>For concluſion and cloſe of this ſubject, we acquainted you, that theſe latter Ordinances of Ordination, Confirmation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have a being in the Scriptures, and the mind and deſires of the faithful; and that we carry them along with us in our journey of ſeparation (as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old did the veſſels of the temple out of outward <hi>Chaldea</hi>) but dare not officiate in them within the territories of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in which we are, till we have paſſed by the ſixth vail over the river Euphrates.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>If they have a being in the Scriptures, then are they the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, and ought alwayes to be taken up in practice, proved from</hi> Mat. 28.20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe Ordinances which have their conſtant exiſtence perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in the word by inſtitution and promiſe, are ever accompanied by the ſame Word and the Spirit thereof for their continued uſe in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114948:41"/>times and places (as you affirme) during the time of their admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration; and thus were the former fort of Ordinances; as Miniſtery, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for others that are ſo upheld, though their being may remaine in the Scriptures, yet their vital exiſtence by ſome occaſions, and in ſome ſeaſons may faile, lie deſerted, and their diſpenſation reſolve into its prime original cauſe; from whence till it flow forth againe into theſe chanels, they cannot be made uſe of without preſumption, as bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the name and power of man. Thus the veſſels and ordinances proper to the legal temple, even when that was deſtroyed, and the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels carried into <hi>Babylon,</hi> had an inſtitution and being in the Scriptures and minds of the godly, yet lay void of their miniſtration, and could not be officiated with either there, or after in their journy of ſeparation, till they were come to Sion, and there ſanctified. Thus alſo, under the Goſpel, Miniſtry and Baptiſme were foretold to be ſucceſſive, as we have ſhewed from this text of <hi>Matthew;</hi> and from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.11. and Chap. 56.5. and in that laſt Scripture, Chap. 56.5. which foretels the continual ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Baptiſme, the place or hand is ſecluded from the ſame promiſe. Nay, when the externality of government was ruined by antichriſt, and made a deſolation, then the adminiſtration of Chriſt was withheld from it, then did the key become another, then was it caſt out by God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.1. Chap. 9.1, 2. Chap. 11.2, and cannot be aſſumed but upon an humane bottomleſs key, till the Lord return into them by the viſible blaſt of the Spirit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.15. Hence the Lord Jeſus himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.26. <hi>Mark.</hi> 13. 23. warnes us to beware of theſe viſible Lo's, as deluſive; and ſhews that ſuch as build them be antichriſts during the antichriſtian time. And this command of Chriſt is to be taught: for as his diſpenſions are various, ſo are his precepts and commands thereunto parallel: when Chriſt and his Spirit were in them, he chargeth his people to obſerve them: when he had left, and antichriſt had ſurpriſed them, he commands his ſervants to beware.</p>
                  <p>Object. You tell us, <hi>That herein the example of the Iſraelites will not help us, becauſe the uſe of thoſe veſſels was confined to a certaine place, the Temple at Jeruſalem: but now God may be worſhipped in any place.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Many of thoſe things which were literal and local to the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites under the Law, are by way of an allegory and in a myſtical ſenſe, fulfilled on the Iſrael of God under the Goſpel. For as then the temple, veſſels, and the uſe of them were confined to a certaine place, mount Sion; ſo Goſpel-conſtitutions with the ordinances proper thereto, are limited to a more manifeſt diſpenſation, which makes them a ſtated viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sion; and this is confined to the two daies of Chriſt, the primitive, and his laſt coming like lightning; it cannot, but upon an antichriſtian root, be taken up when the kingdome is more retired, and neither of theſe two dayes are to be ſeen, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.22. As <hi>Babylon</hi> then was an outward place without the precincts of the land of promiſe; ſo is it now a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Church-ſtate, without the limits of a Goſpel-order: then the king
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:114948:41"/>of Babel ruinated Jeruſalem, and the outward temple, carried the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels thereof into the houſe of his idol-gods, where they were abuſed as quaffing bouls to the praiſe of graven and molten images; now anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, the deſtroying king, hath made deſolate the outward cou<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Chap. 43.14, 19. Chap. 35.8, 10, where the Saints go out of captivity to a <hi>Sion</hi> they were abſent from before: then they in their voyage did bear the Lords veſſels up to <hi>Sion,</hi> which were of no uſe in their travel, till that was accompliſhed, and they ſanctified in their peculiar place: now we carry the Ordinances of external Church-government, as the Lords veſſels, in our minds, but dare not officiate in them till God ſmoke them from his glory and power; according to that precept given to the ſeparation of our time, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 11, 12. Be ye clean that bear the veſſels of the Lord, by way of alluſion to that of old. Thus we may take notice, how the wiſe diſtributer of the times, doth ſo order his diſpenſations in ſuting ſeaſon to ſeaſon, that what was more outward of old, doth under ſhadows and vailes figure out what is now under the Goſpel: he ſo declares the end from the beginning, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing altogether new under the Sun, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.10. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.9. Chap. 3.15. though there be ſomething peculiar to this latter (as every thing hath its appropriated difference:) and I do foreſee wherein Maſter <hi>Elmeſtone</hi> doth think to evade: but when he publiſheth his oppoſitions, I ſhall be willing (if the Lord pleaſe) to meet him; and declare from Scripture the grounds of ſome diſſimiltudes. I ſhall now proceed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve ſome doubts made by you in the 9 and 10 Pages of your book about my ſtudy of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> which I will here divide into a diſtinct Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.</p>

               <head>Paragraph II.</head>
               <p>I Acquainted you, that the reaſon of my diligent ſearch in the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was, becauſe it being a prophecie of all Goſpel-times, contains the full teſtimony of Jeſus, wherein, as in a cabinet, Gods ſeveral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations proper to every period, with Satans oppoſite works, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You wiſh me, in ſearching the viſions of the Apocalypſe, together with the prophets, to do it with humility and ſelf-denyal, as not having any conceit that I have a more excellent ſpirit of revelation then other men: but rather miſtruſt my own conceptions, in which I go alone, unleſs I can prove that I have <hi>Daniels</hi> ſpirit, or juſtifie it by irrefragable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> My deſire is to dive into theſe types and Prophecies with an humble and ſelf-denying mind; and to be free from puffed-up phanſies of mine own wiſdom above others, or beyond the meaſure God hath given me: neither do I acknowledge immediate revelations and inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (as <hi>Daniel</hi> and the Prophets had) to belong to any in our time, but mediate by the word; and for mine own particular, am very cautious what I receive for truth upon theſe Prophecies, either from myſelf or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, untill by comparing Scripture with Scripture, together with the event, it be cleared up to me by manifeſt arguments. As for other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, ſome of them I adjudge to be godly, learned and wiſe, and highly prize their interpretations wherein I finde them to agree with the natural ſenſe of the text. Yet they ſticking in national Churches, and living in the obſcurer times of the tribulation, were ſo veiled, that they could not behold the next diſpenſation of Chriſt, after the 1260 yeers ſhould be expired. But now the date of that time being finiſhed, God hath and will raiſe up a ſeparated people, who ſtand at the Glaſſie ſea, <hi>Revel.</hi> 15.2. in the more bright unfolding of the mind of the Apoſtles and Prophets, both for matter, and time, anſwerable to the promiſe made to ſuch a returning people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.16, I will make darkneſs light before them. And for my ſenſe upon them, as I have with diligent circumſpection examined it my ſelf; ſo I wiſh others truly to weigh it by the balance of the Sanctuary; and they may find, that it comes not from me, but from Chriſt, his Apoſtles and Prophets; nor to me only, but to all thoſe freed redeemed ones, whoſe eyes the Lord hath and will inlighten.</p>
               <p>Your inſuing diſcourſe on this ſubject contains two particulars.</p>
               <p>Object. 1. <hi>The doctrine of Chriſts perſons, offices, the meanes to apply him, faith, the most dangerous errors in faith and worſhip, are better learned out of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:114948:42"/>doctrinal texts of Scripture, then out of the</hi> Revelations: <hi>that holding forth a ſtory of the enemies of the Church, who they ſhould be, how they ſhould op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Church, and at laſt be deſtroyed by her: and of the Churches eſtate before the enemies riſing, under their power, its deliverance, and glorious eſtate in the end; and not of faith, worſhip and good works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The book of the Apocalypſe is doctrinal, as well as other Scriptures: for all Scripture is profitable for doctrine, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.61. if all be doctrinal, then this book is not excluded.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The offices of Chriſt, faith, worſhip and good works are here figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out by allegories, which being compared with other plainer texts, make their ſenſe much more full and bright to ſuch whoſe eyes are open to diſcern the myſtery.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This hiſtorical narration doth not only ſhew who the Churches enemies are, but what they are, and in what they chiefly ſtand, to wit, in the court without, Chap. 11.2. nor barely deſcribes her perſecution by, and deliverance from, but alſo preſents before us the ſeveral diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of God, the divers outward ſtands of his people in their diſtinct periods, both that of the primitive, that under antichriſt, this of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, that of the viſible marriage and call returning, and the glory of new <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> all which are of great and high concernment for a Chriſtians knowledge and walk, Chap. 1.3. and the ignorance whereof may occaſion deep miſery, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.4. Chap, 14.9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beſides, the ſubject we are treating upon (to wit, who the beaſt is, what he is in his latitude, what was the diſpenſation and ſtand of the Saints in myſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi> what it is and ought to be in the ſeaſon of their ſeparation from her) is not expreſſed by plain text of Scriptures, but by dark prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and viſions: by way of propheſie it muſt be, as being to come in the ages when Scripture was penned: and the Lord in divine wiſdome hath delivered it more obſcurely, that the common multitude in hearing might not hear, and in ſeeing might not ſee, but (as was fore-prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied) might be deceived by the beaſt, and partake with <hi>Babylon</hi> in her plagues: as alſo that the curious art of the Spirit might the more be magnified, in its wrapping up ſo much choice matter into ſuch brief com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious platforms; and at laſt in its bright explicating thoſe intricate types and ſayings to his deſpiſed ſervants, which are veiled from the great Rabbies of the time: for ſuch with other cauſes, theſe wayes and judgements of God are parabolically delivered: Now we muſt ſearch them where they are written, if we intend to find.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>The</hi> Revelations <hi>is veiled with ſuch mystical viſions, as very learned Chriſtians cannot uncover the vaile, nor clearly ſee to the end of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> That this is concealed from ſuch as adhere to national Churches, is true, it being propheſied that the veile ſhould lie upon nations, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.7. Chap. 30.8, 9, 10, 11. Chap. 42. 19, 20. alſo Chap. 29.10. The Lord hath poured out upon you Prophets the ſpirit of a deep ſleep; and verſ. 11, 12. And the viſion of all is become unto you like to a book
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:114948:43"/>that is ſealed, which men deliver to one that is learned; ſaying, <hi>Read this, I pray thee;</hi> and he ſaith, <hi>I cannot, for it is ſealed.</hi> And the book is delivered to him that is not learned to read, and he ſaith, <hi>I am not learned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the Spirit meets you in your argumentations of this nature; for thoſe who are moſt eminent amongſt you alleadge, that the viſions of the <hi>Revelations</hi> and Prophets are ſealed, or (as you here ſay) veiled, and we muſt not preſume to dive into ſecrets; ſuch as are of a lower ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, complaine that they are unable to comprehend thoſe myſteries; and tell us that it belongs to ſcholars and learned men. The reaſon of this darkneſs is, becauſe the Lord hath covered you: But behold, in verſ. 18, what the Spirit promiſeth to ſuch whom you adjudge to be blind and deafe, The deaf ſhall hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind ſhall ſee out of obſcurity, and out of darkneſs. And to theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who are inlightned to follow the Lamb, this book, together with the parables of Chriſt, and the Prophets, are as a cloudy pillar to lead them in their journey.</p>
               <p>This worthy prophecie is the laſt book given by the Father unto the great Prophet after his aſcenſion into glory, and ſent by his angel unto his ſervant <hi>John;</hi> and is called a <hi>Revelation</hi> (being delivered to ſhew to his ſervants things that were to come) and that of Jeſus Chriſt; an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical title, and proper to this book, wherein it carries a dignity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the other Scriptures; in the front whereof is promiſed an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Goſpel-bleſſing to ſuch as read, hear, and keep the words of this prophecie; (keeping implies both an underſtanding of, and a way or walk for his people to keep in) and the concluſion is ſealed with a dreadful curſe againſt adders to, or detracters from it. This being the laſt, ſo nobly given, and peculiarly ſtiled by the name of Jeſus Chriſt his Revelation, ſo argues it to be full of majeſty, to be the compleature and perfection of the whole Scripture, and ſhews the matter to be very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and the comprehenſion thereof to be of weighty conſequence for the welfare of the Saints. And therefore it will prove our wiſdome, being here invited, as at the one ſide to count the number of the beaſt, and diſtinguiſh Gods things from mans, Chap. 13.18; ſo on the other ſide to keep cloſe to the adminiſtration therein deciphered for the times in which we live: neither can any wander therefrom, but he muſt needs run into multitude of errors and abſurdities.</p>
               <p>Sir, we ſtand amazed, that you ſhould inveavor to deter us from ſearching into this prophecie, and eclipſe the light thereof from ſhining into our hearts, that thereby (if it were poſſible) you might diſrobe us of our bleſſing: take heed leſt you bring upon your ſelf the curſe. However, we ſhall rather obey the counſel of the Spirit, in counting the number of the beaſt by thoſe rules whereby he is deſcribed, and to ſeek Chriſt in the path of ſeparation in this book, where the call and way are lively ſet before us. I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in the fourth Paragraph.</p>

               <head>Paragraph III.</head>
               <p>WE informed you, that the foundation of the beaſt conſiſteth in an uſurped power of Church-diſcipline footed on mans will without the call of God.</p>
               <p>Object. Againſt this is alledged, <hi>That the foundation of the beaſt lieth not in falſe diſcipline, but doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Doctrine may be conſidered either in a more general ſenſe, for whatever may be taught; and thus diſcipline may be comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that notion, it being teachable; or elſe it is uſed in a narrower and more limited acceptation, as it is oppoſed to, and ſet apart from diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and worſhip: and ſo doctrine reſpects the free grace of God, and juſtification by Jeſus Chriſt: and diſcipline is that part of divinity whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceived, ſpoken, written or exerciſed, which concerns external Church government. Now that the beaſt deſcribed <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf primarily, originally, and radically in this latter part of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline or government, and not in Doctrine, we render theſe inſuing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Scripture declares that his reſidence ſhould be in the court without, which muſt pertaine to the outſide in diſcipline, and not to the inſide in doctrine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Where Antichriſt firſt grounded himſelf, there he brought a whole corruption: for the foundation of the beaſt, and that of truth, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream contraries, and cannot in the ſame thing ſubſiſt together. Now Doctrine, Chriſt believed and profeſſed, were not originally razed in <hi>Rome,</hi> being all born up by the power of Chriſt: but Diſcipline, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to that government peculiar to a ſtated-Church, was wholly defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by that deſtroyer: hereupon in office, he was a meer beaſt; the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the bottomleſs pit, and the Church became bottomleſs of truth, and <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This total defection laſted 1260 yeers, and ſome ſpace after till the ſeventh vial: during all the former ſeaſon he was a beaſt, utterly falſe in his office, and that prevailing; all that while the court was excluded, and the nations had power to trample, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.5. Chap. 11.2. And you cannot for ſhame affirme, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath for ſo long a time been radically falſe in doctrine.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the beaſt had primarily eradicated the principle of doctrine, there could not have been any breathing for an elect number in ſuch an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtation, where neither the grace of God, nor Chriſt, nor juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by him was to be found. But the Scripture doth tell us that there was a ſealed company, a temple, a woman, and feeding for her in Myſtical
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:114948:44"/>
                  <hi>Babylon;</hi> and the event hath cleared, that there were a godly people, a miniſtery of Chriſt to nouriſh them in the Romiſh Church, during the aboveſaid ſeaſon, or elſe it was nowhere for many ages.</p>
               <p n="5">5 It is aſſented to by all the Proteſtant party, that the Pope and his hierarchie make up this beaſt. Now the foundation of the Pope is his Popedom, whoſe riſe was (as Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> well obſerves) from the Authority of <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire; the ground of his hierarchie is their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective orders and prelacies; all which chiefly belong to diſcipline.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Beaſt carries the woman <hi>Babylon,</hi> chap. 17.37. and who knowes not that the Pope with his creatures bear up the Romiſh Church by their eccleſiaſtical government?</p>
               <p n="7">7 Upon a ſerious view you may finde, that moſt, if not all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Tenents of <hi>Rome,</hi> meet radically in ſome falſe maximes of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which argues that to be the corrupt root from whence they ſprou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted forth.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Dragon gave him power, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.2, which is the ſoul and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Antichriſt: The original of doctrine never was in the Devils hands to give, it being upheld by Chriſt; but the externallitie of rule, being forſaken and caſt out by God, was left in Satans power, who inſpired the beaſt therewith; hereupon enſued a Throne and great Authority; all which appertain to diſcipline.</p>
               <p>Your Arguments on the other ſide to prove the beaſt to ground in doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. The foundation of Chriſtian religion lieth in Doctrine, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo doth doth the Antichriſtian.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This your conſequence carries no convincing force, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>cuſus contrarium verum eſt,</hi> The contrarie ſequel may challenge the truer ſenſe: for, as the naturaliſts ſay, <hi>Ars incipit ubi natura deſinit,</hi> Art begins where nature ends; becauſe natural exiſtences being the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of God, begin firſt with the intr<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nſecal, and more eſſential parts, and thence paſs outward to the external; whereas Artificers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the exteriour or outward part. So Chriſtian religion being created of God, founds firſt in the inſide of grace and faith, and from thence operateth to the outſide of diſcipline; whereas the Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being an artificial ſtructure, or man in its baſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.18., initiates in the ſuperficies of diſcipline, and thence goeth gradually into corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2 Your next is taken from <hi>John</hi> 4.2, 3, <hi>He that denies Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, is not of God,</hi> this is the ſpirit of Antichriſt: falſe doctrine then about Chriſts nature, Perſons; and Officers, is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Antichriſtian religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This great Antichriſt doth not directly deny Chriſt his natures, perſons and offices, as ſome petty ones in the primitive time might, but ſecondarily and by conſequence: The firſt Popes and Biſhops at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the 1260 years, were ſo far from denying theſe, that they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and zealouſly preached them up before the world, as you alſo
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:114948:44"/>do: onely they layed another foundation of diſcipline, by taking the government from Chriſt his ſhoulders, and laying it on their own; and ſo in their outward order, or rather diſorder, they denied Chriſt in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, perſons, and offices; and ſet up a falſe Chriſt in regiment. This was not ſo palpable in outward ſhew, but came in Chriſt his name under very ſpecious pretences of Order, Unity, repreſſing hereſies, holineſs, advancing Chriſt and his Kingdom, and therefore did the more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally deceive. If the natures, perſons, and offices our Lord Jeſus had been directly, originally and fundamentally razed in the Romiſh Church, then Gods people could never have remained for ſo many ages in ſuch a viſible ſtand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. The Popes extravagant exerciſe of diſcipline in excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating, ſuſpending, not onely ſimple perſons, but whole Nations, and diſpoſing of all Eccleſiaſtical dignities, was founded on this falſe doctrine, that the Pope is univerſall Biſhop, Chriſts Vicar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 The ſame barely conſidered as a Notion, or thing taught, was not the ground-work of the beaſt; but as uſurped and layed in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline: a ſtone in the quarrie is not the foundation of a houſe, till it be hewen out thence, and diſpoſed in the bottom of the building.</p>
               <p n="2">2 This falſe Tenent of univerſality and viſible headſhip is not a doctrinal (if doctrine be minded as oppoſed to diſcipline) but a diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall principle, as any rational man may apprehend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 4 None can comply with the Beaſt in the foundation of his eſtate, without the loſs of his ſalvation; as who doth rely on another beſides Chriſt, and acknowledgeth him to be ſupream head, under him vicar of Chriſt, and ſubmit to his new Articles of faith: but many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtian have complyed with him in diſcipline, as <hi>Ridly, Latimer,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1 The beaſt (it is true) layed another foundation which pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily and radically was in diſcipline, and ſecondarily ſtruck againſt doctrine, as is ſhewed before: his viſible headſhip and vicarſhip are principles of diſcipline, and thence flow his articles of faith. Beſides, he was fundamentally both in matter and forme a Beaſt for 1260 yeares, and ſome time after, and ſo long the Church is <hi>Babylon,</hi> as before is cleared; and all that time the world worſhipped him: but his Articles of faith are not of ſo long ſtanding, moſt whereof were framed in the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> And then that cannot be his groundwork, which in order of nature and time followed his being: the Cauſe muſt be before the Effect.</p>
               <p n="2">2 This was damnable, as to all, ſo only to thoſe Chriſtians not truely grounded upon the Rock Juſus Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8: who having a meer outſide, ſhallow and ſandie bottome, might be radically ſupplanted by ſuch a totall and deluſive externality: but the Elect having a deeper root then that of the Beaſt, could not in the inward work of grace be by him ſubverted, though they were outwardly clothed with his Livery. Thus <hi>Gregory,</hi> and other Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> before him might be in the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:114948:45"/>yet their Office was eſſentially a Beaſt, they living within the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named time of the tribulation: the like may be ſaid of <hi>Ridly, Hooper,</hi> with the reſt by you nominated. If this beaſt had been originally falſe in the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials of doctrine, it had been damnable to them, as well as to the reſt of the world: for if the foundations be utterly deſtroyed, how can the righteous ſtand? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.3.</p>
               <p>We deſire the Reader rightly to obſerve the difference betwixt Mr. <hi>Elmeſtone</hi> and us in this particular ſubject. He pleads, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is fundamentally falſe in doctrine, which you may finde by his Arguments above; and yet that in her order or Church-conſtitution ſhe is in her ground-work true: for he avers that the Pope hath the true key of Chriſts diſcipline in Ordination, Excommunication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that Friars, Monks Prieſts, Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were radically right in their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip and orders which they had in and from that Church, as you may read in the 29 and 30 pages of his book. The former he is driven to maintaine, or elſe he muſt contradict in writing, what he and his party have publiſhed for many years in open Pulpits, before the Nation, that <hi>Rome</hi> is a falſe Church, and that woman <hi>Babylon</hi> deſcribed in <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. that the Pope is Antichriſt, and the beaſt delineated chap. 13. the latter he is inforced to manage, or elſe he muſt yeild their office to be falſe, which lineally deſcended from the Romiſh Church. But how the body of diſcipline can retaine life in its binding and looſing, where the ſoul of doctrine is departed; or how ſhe can be a bottomleſs pit, and a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to <hi>Sion,</hi> who is bottomly true in her order, and hath the keyes of the Kingdome of heaven to let into and ſhut out of ſuch a viſible Kingdome, (we conceive) cannot be proved by Scripture, nor agree with any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, we affirme, that Church to be in viſible Order falſe, in her memberſhip Babyloniſh, in her office beſtial: but yet as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies foretold, and the event hath manifeſted, that there ſhould be a godly people in that falſe viſibility: ſo for their ſakes the Lord reſerved the root of the Covenant, of doctrine, faith, profeſſion iſſuing thence in prayer, praiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo a gifted miniſtery, coming not from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs key of that Church, but from the immediate gift of Jeſus Chriſt, which you may ſee evinced in the Ceſſation: the former muſt be fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally falſe, or elſe <hi>Rome</hi> could not be <hi>Babylon;</hi> the latter muſt be radically true, or elſe there had been no ſubſiſtence for the Saints. And thus we ſhall end with this third Paragraph.</p>

               <head>Paragraph IV.</head>
               <p>OUrs in brief was this, that the call of God in our times is only for ſeparation without ſtating, or without conſtituting and modelling viſible Churches, and ſitting down therein, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4.</p>
               <p>You may finde it declared in the Ceſſation, that there are two bright and manifeſt dayes of Jeſus Chriſt in the clear adminiſtration of his glory.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That of the primitive apoſtolical day; which continued till the key of the bottomleſs pit was given, and thereby the Sun and aire dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which ſhut up that brightneſs with darkneſs of a ſucceeding night.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The day of his coming like lightning, when the marriage of the Lamb doth againe return, after the final ſubverſion of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Betwixt theſe two periods is the time of the Babyloniſh age, wherein nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe two dayes are to be ſeen in ſuch an open diſpenſation of his power; the kingdome then being inward.</p>
               <p>This latter ſeaſon containes two diſtinct, ſpecial, and very obſervable revolutions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The time of the Saints tribulation laſting 1260 yeers, in which term the true Church is only a ſealed number, diſrobed of the beauty of her exterior order, and viſibly ſeated in the deſart of nations, where her choiceſt witneſſes were outwardly inveſted with defiled and mournful garments, and propheſied in that earth before the God of the earth, where the beaſt had power to prevaile, and tread them under foot, making their eſtate mournful. This begun about the yeer three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ninty, when the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> obtained the primacy of ſeat, and is expired in the yeer 1650, as is ſhewed in the Ceſſation: and as that priority was working ſome ſpace before, yet came not to its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction till after; ſo the conſummation and end of this adverſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was preparing a little before, but not completed till ſome time after 1650. By the end, we may the better underſtand the beginning: for who knows not that the Biſhops and national Presbytery did trample upon the godly with their tyrannical exorbitances within the territories of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanny,</hi> till this laſt Parliament was convened, and ſince in <hi>Scotland?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The next revolution, or time of the ſecond, begins at the end of the firſt; when the time of the tribulation procured by the Antichriſtian apoſtacy is blowing over, the Saints begin to lift up their heads, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Sun Moon, and Stars to darken, the enemies being rewarded by the law of retaliation, and that doubled, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.6. <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.24. and this abides till the end of the vials wrath, the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the marriage of the Lamb be come. If we be not obſtinately blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we may obſerve the admired judgements of God, prepared a little before, but brought to a head about the yeer 1650. For how hath the Lord made bare his holy arme in ſubduing the proudeſt of <hi>Edoms</hi> ſons
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:114948:46"/>(who cryed, Raze it from the foundations) both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland!</hi> the very ſame yeer the beaſt in <hi>Scotland</hi> received a wound never to be cured: the penal Statutes to force the conſcience lay unrepealed till the yeer 1650; and within the circuit thereof, our honoured worthies (for ever to remove the ſenſe of our former bonds) have utterly broken the ſnare, reſtored unto our conſciences our birth-right purchaſed by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: neer and at this time the diſcovery of the beaſt in his full lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude man, began to break forth in theſe ends of the earth, the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies before veiled to be unmasked: many of the Lords people ſeeing the emptineſs and formality of their conſtitutions, with the ſaid divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by them cauſed, begin more zealouſly to affect a general, unity of all the Saints, and to prize the power of godlineſs before their outward forms, which may ſhortly bring them into one way of ſeparation. Theſe unparallel'd mercies of God, bring to our mind a prophetical carmen of that ſweet ſinger of <hi>Iſrael, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee O Lord we do give thanks, unto thee we do give thanks; for that thy name is neer, thy wondrous works declare,</hi> Pſa. 75.1. It is alſo propheſied that theſe admired works ſhould begin in the ends of the earth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.10, 11. Chap. 24.14, 15, 16. Chap. 42.10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.10. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.27, 28, 29; as if it ſhould point out to us who live in the furtheſt point then known Weſt and by North. <hi>Virgil</hi> ſings of our Iſland,
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Et penitus toto diviſus ab orbe Britannus.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The next thing conſiderable is, what is the approved way and walk for the Saints to trace, with their qualifications, during this ſeaſon. The way and walk is a coming out from nations and all falſe ſtatings, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 9. Chap. 18.4. and ſtanding immediately before the throne, without any interpoſition of earthly powers, in a congregating aſſembling way; as alſo upon a ſea of glaſs, in the abundant and perſpicuous unfolding of the Scriptures compared to glaſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18; which is ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the fiery operation of the Spirit to burn up what is beſtial and combuſtible, and to adminiſter light and heat to the truth, Chap. 14.3. Chap. 15.2.</p>
               <p>The qualities of theſe ſeparated people are, Firſt, their clothing with white robes of joy, praiſes and purity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Palms in their hands, as ſymbols of their victory over the beaſt, his image, mark, name, and the number thereof, Chap. 7.9.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They are ſtiled harpers, Chap. 14.2, as ſinging the ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Lamb, for their outward and inward redemption from bondage.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Theſe are not defiled with women, or falſe Churches: for they are virgins.</p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:114948:46"/>
               <p> Fifthly, They follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth, in all his outgoings by ſeparation; and being the firſt beginners in this noble walk, are called the firſt fruits unto God, verſ. 4.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, In their mouths or Miniſtery is found no guile, being therein without fault before the throne of God.</p>
               <p>Here you may behold an alterable ſtand and condition differing from the former of the tribulation; and a figure of ſeparation, with diſtinct aſſemblings, and a joyful harping in Miniſtery, prayer, praiſings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not the leaſt ſymbol of ſitting down in a viſible married way, but rather the contrary.</p>
               <p>For firſt, they are typed out in the form of virgins: when the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage comes, they are deciphered in the emblem of a married wife, Chap. 19.7, 8.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Theſe virgins ſit not down with, but follow the Lamb, and that whitherſoever he goeth: the phraſe <hi>whitherſoever</hi> intimates a variety of Chriſts outgoing, and the Saints following him in ſeveral ſteps and gradations to a higher perfection. Their multitude, purity of array, and clearneſs of knowledge, are not ſo exact at the beginning (it being a gradual work) but are ſet forth (according to the uſual manner of this prophecie) in the firſt common type, as they are in the higheſt degree of their virgin-like perfection, as is declared in the fifth Section follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour preſents a moſt pathetical platform of the ſeparated Saints in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. by the ſimilitude of ten virgins that went forth to meet the bridegroom. The time of this going forth is ſomewhat darkly hinted in verſ. 1. Then ſhall the kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but becauſe that is obſcure, therefore doth the divine Wiſdom more brightly declare, in verſ. 5, 6. that the time is after the long abſence of Chriſt in the Antichriſtian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, and the ſlumbering, nay, deep ſleeping of all in that night: and then verſ. 6, at the midnight of ſecurity (to wit, at the harveſt, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the vials wrath, when all errors in their latitude were grown to their height, and works of darkneſs in pride, covetouſneſs, oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſelf-ſeeking, contention, riot, laſciviouſneſs, with all wickedneſs, were committed with a high hand, and ripe for cutting down) then was the voice heard of the bridegrooms coming, with a conſtraining force, Go ye forth to meet him (the ſum of the Miniſtery of the ſeparation.) The call muſt be before the going out, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. for it is that which awakens, raiſeth and accompanieth them in their paſſage towards the marriage. The ſpiritual commerce in buying and ſelling, the ſhutting of the door againſt the fooliſh while they were thus trading, their knocking at the door after ſhut in hope of admittance, can no way agree with the laſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral reſurrection, but duely pondered, together with other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, muſt belong to the next marriage to come.</p>
               <p>In this parable we may ſee, that there was a ſpace of time wherein the Saints were Virgins, and a gradual preparing and trimming before en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the wedding-Chamber: and after, verſ. 10, Thoſe that were
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114948:47"/>ready, went in with him to the marriage, anſwerable to <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.7, 8, 9; His wife hath made her ſelf ready, hath the grant of the wedding-gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the call to marriage-ſupper. Bleſſed is he that ſhall be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this nuptial feaſt: for none that are unfurniſhed, uncircumciſed, or unclean, ſhall enter thereinto, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.1. <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.21; therefore will the door be ſhut againſt the fooliſh virgins. Let us take the counſel of our Lord, verſ. 13, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.36, Watch and pray, that ye may be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worthy to eſcape all theſe things (<hi>viz.</hi> the vials wrath) and to ſtand before the Son of man, when he comes in the glory of his Spirit. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing, taking, and trimming of the Lamps both of the wiſe and fooliſh virgins, is now: the diſcerning of the one from the other, about the ſixth vial, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.15. the wedding, is after the vials pouring on Antichriſt. As theſe virgins go from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Lord by his call, guidance and protection leads before, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.12, ſo do they follow the Lamb: as they have an aſpect toward the marriage, &amp; to Chriſt coming then in the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manifeſtation of the Spirit, ſo do they go forth to meet the bridegroom.</p>
               <p>There be ſome other difficulties to be unfolded in this text, which for brevity I ſhall here omit, till I ſee my opponents exceptions.</p>
               <p>In the going forth or travelling of theſe virgins, or returners towards the marriage, we find two noted and obſervable paſſages. The firſt-is from the beaſt, his earth, ſea, rivers and fountains, and throne, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſecond is over the river Euphrates at the ſixth vial, Chap. 16. The Saints going over this great river, are ſtiled the kings of the Eaſt, which is not a proper, but figurative and borrowed ſpeech, as well as the earth, ſea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and are ſo tearmed, partly in alluſion to the kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> who went to the temple by the way of the Eaſt gate, <hi>Ezek</hi> 36.12. partly for that they will be increaſing flouriſhing kings, reſembling the Sun-riſing, by which they are diſtinguiſhed from the kings of nations, who are then declining and upon their fall, like to the Sun in the Weſt: partly as they will reſemble their King Chriſt, who is called the Angel of the Eaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. And theſe are not only Jews, but Gentiles alſo, unleſs you intend to diſrobe them of their kingly dignity, and do ſuppoſe that the Dragon, Beaſt, falſe Prophets, kings of the whole world, with their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, do make war only againſt the Jews, and are not gathered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the godly Gentiles; an idle fancy to imagine. Beſides, theſe are the men that pour out their vial into the aire.</p>
               <p>Thus far in general. But becauſe you ſeem to require it, and that it may more fitly anſwer yours, we ſhall now divide it into particular Reaſons, why this walk of theſe harpers is ſeparation without ſtating.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Our firſt ground is, becauſe in this ſeaſon, there is no divine call for viſible Church-conſtitution or marriage: if there be, we ſhould deſire to be informed where: the higheſt we can finde in the Scripture, is for ſeparation and rewarding. There was never any new work begun in Church-matters either not in being before, or after a general and long privation, without a new call to authorize and impower men for the work: <hi>Noah</hi> built not his ark till God commanded him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.14. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:114948:47"/>departed not from his country till the Lord ſaid unto him, Get thee out, Chap. 12.1. <hi>Aaron</hi> aſſumed not the honor of the Prieſthood, till called of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. nay, Chriſt our Lord honoured not himſelf, but he that ſaid unto him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> verſ. 5. <hi>David</hi> durſt not build a reſting place for his God, without asking counſel of the Prophet, the Lords oracle; and being forbidden, prepared abundantly for the work, but durſt not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to build, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.1, 3. Chap. 29. his ſon <hi>Solomon,</hi> a king of Peace, being called, begun and finiſhed that magnificent building, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.12. Chap. 28.6. the ſame temple being after ruinated by the king of <hi>Babylon,</hi> was not reedified, but by a heavenly voice directing <hi>Cyrus</hi> and the Jews to do it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.28. Chap. 45.1, 4.2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.23. <hi>Ezra.</hi> 1.2, 3. the Apoſtles waited at Jeruſalem, and went not forth to ſtate viſible Churches, till they received power from heaven calling and priviledging them for that deſigne: <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4. Chap. 2.2. And queſtionleſs Jeſus Chriſt in his Revelation, exactly marking out and ſhewing to his ſervants all the remarkable changes and diſpenſations of his Saints, would after ſo long a ceſſation and confuſion of their firſt order (the greateſt for matter and time that ever was) have in this book confirmed the work of ſtating, and made it indubitable by his call in its firſt return, as well as that of ſeparation, if there had been any ſuch fabrick now to be erected. If you object the primitive call, The Ceſſation of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing, and the other new call to come, makes that to be to us inſufficient.</p>
               <p>Again, there is not any viſible adminiſtration of the Spirit to begin any Church-conſtitution ſince the windes were with held, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.1. nor will be till the ſame winds are looſed, and the Spirit again poured out in a viſible ſymbol, as is proved in the Ceſſation, <hi>Quaer.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. Our next ground why we cannot at this time ſtate, and but only ſeparate, is, becauſe the book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> preſcribes two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and ſevered periods for ſeparation, and viſible Church-marriage: the firſt to be during the rewarding by war, Chap. 18.4, 6. the laſt to be after a full ſeparation, and the downfal of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Chap. 19.7, 9. Now time is Gods peculiar prerogative and proper intereſt: who can appoint him the times, without intrenching upon his incommunicable royalty? <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.44. Again, as there is a time fixed for every purpoſe, ſo every thing is beautiful in its time, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.1, 11. but out of his ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, there is and muſt be a deformity and diſproportion: the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe many concurrences fall into the point of opportunity, that contributes a comlineſs, goodneſs, and ſometimes truth of exiſtence to the thing or action: which being done out of its ſeaſon, loſeth its grace and beauty, and in Church matters is vaine, falſe and unlawful. Thus in this honourable work of ſtating, there will at that day be the raine of God, the bright and powerful adminiſtration of the Spirit, the grant and gift of the beautiful wedding garment, the lively call of Chriſt to make it incomparably glorious, and of ſurpaſſing luſtre: but now in this your day there is not only the want, but the contrary to all theſe, which cauſeth it be both obſcure, formal, narrow, as alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uniting, dangerous, and ſinful.</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:114948:48"/>
               <p> Now the harpers above ſpecified, are virgins, not the defiled married women; they are obedient followers of the Lamb in the call of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, are not intruders and goers before him in the act of ſtating.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3. The third is, becauſe there is not now a ſufficient diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of light, ſutable for the majeſty of a Goſpel-conſtitution. How various are <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iens obſervations about the primitive patern, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence their wayes of corporating, which they all pretend to be thereby compoſed! and yet amongſt theſe mulutudes is there not one, but diſagrees in the outward matter with that apoſtolical order, whether it be in <hi>Rome,</hi> Epiſcopacy, with you, the Browniſts, Independents, Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in the internal form, they are all contrary to that rule by a direct diameter. Moreover, there is not a competent light to judge the fitneſs of men for members, of whom there will be a notable tryal by the ſixth vial, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.15; nor a clearneſs of diſcovery to know the high Goſpel-rules by which they ſhould walk, Antichriſt hath ſo defaced theſe, that they are ſcarcely known amongſt men, which we ſhall ſpeak of in the following reaſon: neither is there a requiſite knowledge judically to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in all, nay many caſes, what is error, or hereſie: it may be, and for the moſt part happens, that long and deep-rooted error fixed in mens minds, provokes them to cenſure and reject that as erronious, that is a new unmasking of their old miſtakes; and ſo the Spirit of truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing the myſtery of iniquity, is in his ſervants and meſſengers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for an heretick: our Saviours counſel to theſe men, is, <hi>Let them grow together till harveſt, leſt ye pluck up the wheat alſo,</hi> Matth. 13.29. and at the harveſt they are not diſtinguiſhed by Church-cenſures, but by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. The reaſon of this obſcurity is, becauſe theſe are but the daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, or new breakings forth of light, in which it is neither day nor night, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.6, 7. Whereas the day of Jeſus Chriſt ſhall ſhine from Eaſt to Weſt like lightning, with an univerſal flaſhing brightneſs, moſt perſpicuouſly to manifeſt all theſe to his choſen: and then the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will appear by evident demonſtration to be the Lords own doing.</p>

Another ground is, becauſe during this time the beſt of Saints are but deveſting themſelves from their former outward filth, and but ſhaking off the duſt which for ſuch a length of time remained on them: they are not as yet come to that hight of righteouſneſs requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in a Goſpel-order in point of love and mutual fellowſhip.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here lay down in a treble ſort of righteouſneſs, by which the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſtraine of our times may be tryed.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the civil worldly righteouſneſs, which ſtandeth in defect and fall of Reaſon beneath its native ſphere; and yet is in ſome degree reſerved to imband an uphold civil ſocieties and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths: the rule of this, is, firſt himſelf, then his neighbors; a fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and reſpect to the well-being of others, but the chiefeſt of his aimes are bounded within the circumference of his own private advantages: whatever is beneath this, is meerly brutiſh; nay, deviliſh, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to all reaſonable conſociations.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:114948:48"/> 2. The ſecond is the legal, conſiſting in the genuine purity of reaſon: and its axiome is, His neighbor as himſelf, as equally balancing the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of others with his own benefit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third is that of the Goſpel, a righteouſneſs in its actings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding that of the Scribes and Phariſees, having in it a ſuperlative ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural excellency: and its rule is, His neighbor on brother above and beyond himſelf. A new commandment I write unto you, that you love one another, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.8. the ſcope of which command is, that ye love one another as Chriſt hath loved you, <hi>John</hi> 15.12, 13; who loved his Saints above himſelf, in that he laid down his life for them: ſo ought we for the brethren, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.6; if our lives in the extent, much more all other inferior intereſſes ought to be denied in their behalf. Alſo in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5, and in many other Scriptures, we find the Goſpel-righteouſneſs and commands to tranſcend that of the law.</p>
               <p>Now, if the general wayes, dealings and intercourſe of Chriſtians be examined by theſe rules, how far ſhort do they come of the high glory of a Goſpel-walk? yea, where is the man to be ſeen that obſerves the legal, in conſidering his neighbors caſe as his own? nay, the civil world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rule is ſo defaced, that the moſt of men are altogether ſelf; and let their neighbor ſink or ſwim, all is one to them: inſomuch as it is grown to a common Proverb, <hi>Every man for himſelf;</hi> a maxime framed in hell, and uſually put in Action on Earth, throughout the whole Chriſtian world, and that by many who in words ſeemingly defie to own it. Doth not that covetouſneſs (which by the Spirits verdict is<note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 6.10.</note> the root of all evil,<note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 5.5.</note> idolatry it ſelf, and hath in it<note n="*" place="margin">Pro. 1.19.</note> the cry of blood) ſo overſpread the face of all interchanges, that the common current thereof tends to deceit, over-reaching, cruelty, oppreſſion, devouring one another, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up themſelves by the ruines of multitudes, and they deemed the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt men that gaine moſt by ſuch indirect dealings? Indeed many of the ſtated members boaſt much of a Gpſpel walk; but who amongſt them practiſeth the aboveſaid Evangelical precepts? and how little differing they are from the common ſtream of ſelfiſhneſs, and how unfit to ſtate and ſit down in ſo much defection and pollution, we leave to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the wife. And ſo great is the miſery, that the Miniſtery it ſelf, which ſhould be as the mouth of God to ſet forth the light of a Goſpel-converſation, doth ſo eclipſe and darken the natural luſtre of thoſe noble commands of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, ſo mangle and pervert their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſenſe by conforming them to the corruptions of the times, that they preſent to the face of the people a kind of worldly Goſpel, and imprint in their mind ſuch degenerate principles, as ſooths up and hardens them in the like wretched tyranny. Hereupon the Spirit foreſeeing the devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe times, complaines, that judgement is turned backward, truth is faln in the ſtreets, and equity cannot enter: yea truth faileth, and there was no judgement, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.14, 15, 16. as alſo, that the good man is periſhed from the earth, there is none upright amongſt men, they all lie in wait for blood, they hunt every man his brother with a net;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114948:49"/>that the beſt in his walk is as a brier, the moſt upright like a thorn hedge, <hi>Mica.</hi> 7.2, 4. Yea, the defection is ſo univerſal, that the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſaith<note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 16.15.</note> 
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.8, that when he comes (to wit, in the brightneſs of Miniſtry to reprove the worlds righteouſneſs) ſhall be find faith on earth? that is, in the walk on faith which conſiſteth in love, wherein the excellency of a Goſpel-way reſideth, <hi>John</hi> 13.35. Chap. 15.9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12.31. Chap. 14. Nay, the above-named worldly rudiments are ſo twiſted into the whole frame of this Euphratean fabrick, that the ſeparated people themſelves, though in their aimes and deſires they are off, yet actually, by reaſon of extream exigencies for private neceſſaries, they cannot attaine to thoſe high Evangelical rules of charity, till Chriſt prepare away for theſe Eaſtern riſing kings over the river Euphrates, by drying up theſe waters. They are diſtinguiſhed from the beaſt in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks, but not from the great river, nor from that aire in which as yet they breath, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.12, 17. and cannot ſit down in a Goſpel or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der till theſe obſtacles and pollutions be removed, and they receive the grant of their beautiful wedding-garments, the righteouſneſs of the Saints, Cap. 19.8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 5. The day of the vials pouring is a time of war and blood-ſhedding: and it is the wiſe Decree of God, firſt to waſh away the filth of the daughter of Sion, and to purge the blood of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from the midſt of her by the Spirit of judgement and burning, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.4, and after that to create upon all her aſſemblies a cloud and ſmoke by day, and a pillar of fire by night, verſ. 5. Where obſerve, that this open diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that gives being to Church-ſtating (as you may finde proved in the Ceſſation, <hi>Quaere</hi> 2.) comes not from heaven till after theſe combuſtions are put to a period, and the Saints purged from filth and blood: and then it is done by a new creation. Alſo <hi>Revel.</hi> 15.8. at that marriage-ſeaſon, the temple was filled with ſmoak from Gods glory and power, to wit, a manifeſt pouring out of the Spirit to reſtore the keys, and by them a power given to open the temple for viſible entrance, Chap. 11.19. but before that day, no man could enter into the temple till the ſeven plagues of the ſeven Angels were fulfilled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 6. A further reaſon of the weakneſs and unwarrantableneſs of all Church-conſtitutions in our times, may be the diviſions and rents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the godly cauſed by theſe forms, alſo other effects and defects wherein they are directly oppoſite to the primitive, which are more fully recited in the Epiſtle to the Reader.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 7. The laſt reaſon why it is now by ſeparation without ſtating, is, becauſe this return from myſtical <hi>Babylon</hi> is not fully accompliſhed at once, but is traced by diſtinct ſteps and degrees, <hi>Cam.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.11, 12. it hath a journey in it, and a gradual going onward towards the viſible marriage of Sion, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old travelled out of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> and the nations with their faces towards outward Sion. Hence the prodigal (who types out the Gentiles) his return from the ſtrange country <hi>Babylon</hi> to his native home, is intimated to be a long journey, his father meeting
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:114948:49"/>him afar off; in which ſpiritual paſſage he was imbraced, kiſſed, jewel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before he entred into the houſe.</p>
               <p>Alſo from the firſt call for the going out of, and rewarding <hi>Babylon, Rev.</hi> 8.4, 6. to the marriage and call thereto, chap. 19, 7, 8, 9. there is a tract of time interceding, as before: For as <hi>Rome</hi> was not built at once, but <hi>gradatim,</hi> by ſeveral trumpets, chap. 8 and 9. ſo ſhe goes not down toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but by degrees, and certain intervals by the vials. Hereupon chap. 11.18, 19. Enemies muſt firſt be deſtroyed, by ſeveral diſtances, before the Temple in Heaven was opened. To this agrees that of <hi>Matthew</hi> 13. where during the harveſt (which notes out this laſt holy war, and the time of ſeparation, as we can clear<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, if deſired) the Antichriſtian Enemies, the tares muſt firſt be cuſt down and burned, before the wheat is gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the barn, the viſible Church; which muſt imply ſome ſpace of time, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. This journey of ſeparation is deſcribed in the Prophets; and in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.8, 9, 10. is called a way in the wilderneſs: that as the Saints had their place and abode in the wilderneſs during the foregoing ſeaſon for 1260 years, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.6, 14. ſo now the Lord prepares a way for her to go out by returning: and the ſame is ſtiled a high-way, being paved and caſt up by the Spirit above the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> earthly ſtation, as that on high or above to the, wiſe: it is alſo by a redoubled ſpeech termed an high-way, and a way, as being a way in it ſelf, which muſt have a ſpace to be traced in: and is for form a way of holineſs, as that more pure then the times before. And that this belongs to a diſtinguiſhed people, is evident, ver. 10. where they are entitled ranſomed ſeparated ones, and returners to <hi>Sion,</hi> not ſtaters in <hi>Sion;</hi> and travellers and walkers in the way, not ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters down in Church-conſtitutions. Alſo for time, it muſt pertain to this laſt departing, becauſe the text attributes everlaſting joy to be on their heads, which can be applyed to not former ſeparation, either to that out of <hi>Egypt, Chaldea,</hi> or the primitive, all theſe being after darkened by a ſucceeding ſorrowful night: onely this laſt ſhall have everlaſting joy, it being the paſſage to that glorious Kingdome, which ſhall never be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed as were the former, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.44. chap. 7.18, 27. Beſides, waters and ſtreams are ſaid to break out in this deſart, ver. 6 7, which was not literally fulfilled in the Jewes departure from outward <hi>Chaldea.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the leaping of the lame or him that halteth, and the ſinging of the dumb, ver. 6. fitly alludes to the Harpers: the incouraging of the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be ſtrong, and Gods coming with vengence and a recompence to ſave, ver. 4, fitly anſwers to the recompenſing and rewarding by the Vials.</p>
               <p>If you except againſt this, we deſire to know what the way is, when it is, and who are the walkers in it. This Prophet further calls this way in the wilderneſs a new thing, then ſpringing forth, in which the Lord, the light of the world, will lead his blind people, chap. 43.19. chap. 42.16. Likewiſe the Spirit by <hi>Hoſea</hi> confirms the ſame, chap. 2.14, 15, 16, 17, 18. Behold, ſaith the Lord, I will allure her (in drawing her out) I will cauſe her to walk in the wilderneſs (for ſo is the true original, and not <hi>I will
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:114948:50"/>bring her,</hi> as is tranſlated: before ſhe ſate in, now ſhe walks out of the wilderneſs) I will give her her vines from thence (where vines are meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymically taken for the fruits of the vines, which metaphorically ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols the comfort of the Spirit, or that love which is better then wine.) Here are alſo many other pretious promiſes to the walkers in this way, the laſt whereof is a quiet ſitting down, and a ceſſation from war: all which ſhews a ſpace of time to walk in this way: and then (agreeable to <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.97.) I will marry thee to mee for ever. Alſo the River Euphrates men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the fourth Reaſon, whoſe waters will be dried up to prepare for a paſſage over by the ſixth Vial, chap. 16. relates to this journey. We being as yet on this ſide that river, and not off from the <hi>Euphratean</hi> world, and its affairs, nor come into the ſpirituall land of promiſed, muſt be till then within the wilderneſs of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and can erect no viſible temple, but it muſt be built with <hi>Babylons</hi> ſtones, ſtand in her territories, and ſo be <hi>Babylons</hi> temple. This will be dangerous, becauſe the Vials wherein the ſeven laſt plagues of God are wrapped up, will irreſiſtably pour out their wrath upon it, either by war and the puniſhments thereof, or at leaſt by a ſharpe and ſearching diſcovery. I ſhall therefore adviſe you, with all my Chriſtian friends whereſoever, to come off from ſuch like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements, leſt ye partake with <hi>Babylon</hi> in her plagues, and that your works burn not at the appearance of Jeſus Chriſt: and this you will finde to be ſeaſonable Counſel, if the Lord open your eyes to embrace it.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This of ſeparation from ſpiritual <hi>Babel</hi> is called a new thing then ſpringing forth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.19. chap. 42.16. and ſo muſt in ſome reſpect be differing from all the former.</p>
                  <p>Againe, we grant the ſeparations of former times were preſently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with congregating, miniſtery, prayer, with other ſervices that were lawfully exerciſed before their departure, as we do the like now: but withall denie that thoſe ſervants of God aſſumed any new thing, or an old after its diſpenſation lay void, without a new call and warrant for the work.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We ſhall begin with that of <hi>Abrahams;</hi> who as he ſeparated not till God called him from his Country, and his Fathers houſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.2, 3, 4. ſo in this his journey he made no innovation, but onely
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:114948:50"/>exerciſed himſelf in Miniſtery, Prayer, and the like, which he emitted not in <hi>Chaldaea:</hi> and after he came into <hi>Canaan,</hi> took not up the ſigne of Circumciſion, till he received an expreſs command from Heaven, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10, 11, 12. and this was not till 24 yeers after his firſt entrance into the Land of promiſe, as appears by comparing ver. 1. with chap. 12.3; and near 30 yeers from his going out from <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by Scripture-conſent.</p>
                  <p>To that of <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſtating in the wilderneſs upon their going forth from <hi>Egypt,</hi> we ſay, 1. That they were ſeparated from <hi>Egypt,</hi> both people and land, being paſſed through the red Sea; but we are not yet ſo from <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> nor can be, till the way be traced over <hi>Euphrates.</hi> 2. They, being thus ſevered, rema<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ned a bare ſeparated people a yeer or more, as you confeſs. 3. After that, their marriage or Church-ſtate was not contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by themſelves, for the Lord himſelf begun it at mount <hi>Smai,</hi> where they had a call, pattern and warrant for all they did, all which was ſmoked by the cloud of Gods glory: but you can produce no ſuch call nor glory for any of your new-built conſtitutions; nor prove the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the primitive through the ſeaſon of the apoſtacy.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Jewes returne from <hi>Babylon,</hi> we anſwer, That they did not rebuild the Temple in their voyage of ſeparation, but firſt came to <hi>Sion,</hi> the proper reſting place: and then begun it by vertue of an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly call directing <hi>Cyrus</hi> and the Jewes for that deſigne; and by the incouragement of the Prophets <hi>Haggai,</hi> and <hi>Zachariah,</hi> Iſa. 44.28. chap. 45.4. <hi>Ezra.</hi> 5.12.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> Here you produce againſt us the ſaying of the Jewes, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>It is not time to build.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> They being come to <hi>Sion</hi> and called of God to the work, might juſtly be reproved for ſlacking their hands. Notwithſtanding if they ſhould have erected that divine edifice in their journey before arrived there, they might have met with a ſharper rebuke and puniſhment. The crime is more hainous to uſurpe a power, and build upon their own bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, then to neglect it in its time, though I juſtifie neither. However, God calls not his people to any ſuch work now, in theſe our travels from myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <hi>Babell:</hi> neither can man do it in its owne ſeaſon (this ſpiritual fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick being not built by hands, as the outward was) but the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf muſt firſt create it by the pouring out of his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Your temerity in conſtituting your Church by your owne power, before God begins it, and charging us, as being too too ſlow, for waiting his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time, brings to our mind a ſtory in <hi>Exodus,</hi> chap. 32. When <hi>Moſes</hi> there ſeemed to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to tarry too long; they as impatient of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, muſt needs go before God, and frame a golden Calfe by their own imaginations, as you now do a beſtiall Idol.</p>
                  <p>To that of the primitive, we reply, that the Diſciples uſed miniſtery, prayer, baptiſme, and at laſt received the communion, but did not ſtate any viſible Churches: and after Chriſts reſurrection from the dead, they tarried at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> expecting the promiſe of the Father to impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:114948:51"/>them for the ſame work. Indeed when they were firſt married by God, by the glorious emiſſion of the Spirit, they by vertue thereof as ſons of the Church married in others by bringing them into that Goſpel-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. So that when viſible Churches are exiſting, men are received in as married members; when not, there can be no entrance further, then into a Covenant, memberſhip, waiting the times of God.</p>

                  <p>Anſw. This rule we infringe not, but imbrace and follow. For as we flee from the beaſt, his image, marke, name and number; ſo we walk in that good way of aſſembling, and exerciſe ſuch ordinances as are now ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited by the Lord. But you are ſo far from doing good upon the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil, that you run from one evil of the Biſhops, and ruſh into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Presbytery; from <hi>Babylon</hi> and the beaſt, into <hi>Babylon</hi> and the ſame beaſt newly tranſlated.</p>

You alſo in your principles and words unchurch all the leſſer independent bodies: the like do they to you, and all others not of their way. Therefore, for you to lay ſo high a charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, and do the ſame things, ſeemes to favour of partiality, and come under the reproof of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For clearing our ſelves, we anſwer, <hi>Vivimus legibus, non exemplis:</hi> We ſet not the practices of men, but the lawes of God for our exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar. That of man hath eſpecially from the firſt beginning, and ſo down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Antichriſtian darkneſs, been the common miſleading mark of Chriſtians, both in Papacy, Epiſcopacy, and the like. And the differing and diſagreeing formes of Churches in our age, may teach how invalid humane authority is in the things of God. But the word of God (we are aſſured) is an unerring rule, by which we ſhall endeavour to ſteer our courſe, and not by the wandering notion of learned men. Our recourſe is onely to the Law and Teſtimony for proof, whether you, they, or we be righteſt. In the interim, we condemn not the grace of Chriſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we finde it, nor the generation of the righteous as righteous: Yet if their outward way be condemnable by the word of God, we conceive it true humility and piety to judge accordingly, and charity to acquaint them therewith. Thus we ſhall end with your general exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the whole; and ſhall in the next place proceed to the more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, framed againſt ſome particular reaſons before nominated, which we will divide into ſeveral Sections.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This your aſſertion conſiſteth of many fallacies, which muſt be drawn out in their parts to clear up the truth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As that <hi>Babylon</hi> is not onely <hi>Rome</hi> with her adjacent territories, but the great City, chap. 17.18. reaching where out Lord was ſlaine; chap. 11.8. above two thouſand miles diſtant from <hi>Rome;</hi> and duely pondered, muſt be as large as the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Chriſtian Empire: and ſo compriſeth <hi>England, Scotland, France,</hi> or what place ſoever hath a falſe Church, or beaſtly power to bear it up.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Theſe laſt plagues of God, are not onely againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> but every land where <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Churches are reſiding, even all Chriſtian Nations. The ſame whirlwind in theſe latter daies, is ſaid to begin at the ends of the earth, and to go from Nation to Nation, <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.31, 32, 33. chap. 23.19, 20. chap. 30.23, 24. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.5, 6. and to be univerſall, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. chap. 34. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.35. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.37. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We have ſeen the beginnings of it in our Dominion; the effects whereof were lately like to fall on ſome men of note in <hi>England. Caetera taceo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. This call of ſeparation, is not ſimply from <hi>Rome</hi> as an outward place, but from all Antichriſtian ſtands, whether Romiſh, Epiſcopal, Presbyterial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the call is generall, and the ſureſt remedy to eſcape the general judgement.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The pouring theſe plagues is not all at once by the laſt or ſome of the laſt vials; it is gradual by every vial, degree after degree. For all the Angels pour out in their order upon the Earth, Sea, Rivers, and fountains, Sun, and Throne of the beaſt, upon the great river <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and the aire, chap. 16.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Not the Kings of the earth, but the ſeparated people are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal inſtruments in rewarding: for the text bids firſt Come out of her my people, then reward. States that come off, may be aſſiſtants.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But this was done by the ten hornes, ten Kings,</hi> chap. 17.16, 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The reading of the text muſt be warily obſerved, for the better underſtanding thereof. The moſt and authentick Greek copies have it, The ten horns and the beaſt ſhall hate the Whore; but <hi>Aretas,</hi> whom the vulgar Latine followes, renders it, The ten horns on or upon the beaſt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:114948:52"/>ſhall hate: both ſenſes are true; and in both the hornes and the beaſt are coupled together; the hornes and the beaſt hate, alſo the horns hating are faſtened on the beaſt. And as the horns are theſe ten, for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Chriſtians, not for number (for they did not all ten, but ſome of them deteſt this Whore:) to the ſame Chriſtian beaſt that abhors, muſt be taken by the like Synecdoche, the whole for the part; to wit, the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal and Presbyterial beaſt ſhall hate, not the Papal; and the Whore defied muſt muſt be the great Whore, or grandmother <hi>Rome,</hi> who in her whordoms was grown over-foul: They deteſted not the leſſer and more ſpecious daughters, of whom themſelves were a part, nor yet the the woman <hi>Babylon</hi> in her extent: for they moſt ſadly mourned for her downfall, their riches and delicacies being taken away with her, chap. 18.9, 10. Neither did they abominate the beaſt; but beeing faſtned on him, did aſſiſt him with their Armies againſt the ſitter on the white horſe and his Armies; and both hornes and beaſt fell together; ch. 19.11. to the end. The above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid hating appeares to us to allude to the Proteſtant Princes, who to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their beaſt (the eccleſiaſtical hierariches either Epiſcopall or Presbyteriall) did hate, make deſolate and naked, conſume and burn up the whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> as having nothing to do with her in their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Now the rewarders before ſpecified, were not horns on the beaſt, being ſevered from the very number of his name: and being on Chriſts ſide, follow him upon white horſes to ſubdue the beaſt and horns toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the time of the call of ſeparation, I ſhal ſpeak in the next place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> You go on, and ſay, <hi>that the ſpiritual ſeparation made by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Princes and Churches from</hi> Rome <hi>in doctrine and worſhip, as they had a warrant from this call; the reaſon whereof belonging to all times and perſons not to partake in</hi> Romes <hi>ſins, do ſufficiently inforce it, ſo had they preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant grounds from other Scriptures and commands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here are many inſinuations alſo couched up in this ſentence, which muſt be examined in their parts. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What you here intend by your ſpiritual ſeparation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How you can juſtifie a ſpiritual ſeparation to be made by Princes; you mean, I ſuppoſe, by their laws. If it be ſpiritual, it muſt be cauſed by the free motion of the Spirit, conſtraining a people by the linkes of love, and not inforced by the cumpulſive lawes of men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You affirme your ſeparation to be in doctrine and worſhip: it ſeemes, you are aſhamed to ſay in diſcipline, as being convinced in your conſcience, that yours is the ſame radically with <hi>Rome.</hi> If your Church be grounded upon a Bayloniſh diſcipline, it cannot be a viſible <hi>Sion, Jer.</hi> 51.26.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. You tell us, they had a warrant for it from this call; by which at at one breath you blow downe all you built before.<note place="margin">Marte ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt ſubiti per mutua vulnera fratres.</note> For if this call be not, untill Kings join together to deſtroy <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, about the laſt or ſome of the laſt vials; and that then it is directed to ſuch onely who are hid in that City with the adjacent territories, how can theſe be applyed to Proteſtant Princes and Churches? They renounced <hi>Rome</hi> long before;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:114948:52"/>they were not hid in that City, nor the adjacent territories, nor fled they from thence by a perſonal flight. Theſe two extremes will hardly come together.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This call here ſpecified pertains not to all times and perſons. For as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to be in outward <hi>Babylon</hi> for the ſpace of ſeventy yeers, before the call for their departure; ſo the woman was to remain in the myſtical for a full ſeaſon, even 1260 yeers, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.6, as before: the wheat and tares were to grow together till harveſt, which belongs to the vials, chap. 14. and then this call for ſeparation had its peculiar time prefixed, the war and it being conjoyned together. The primitive Saints failing in their firſt love, ſunk into the ſame earthly confuſed condition, and were left aſleep in that wilderneſs for a full ſeaſon, till the times of God came for their deliverance from bondage.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This of Proteſtantiſme cannot properly be termed a ſeparation in reſpect of Church-conſtitution, but rather a dividing of the kingdom, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.41. The true ſeparation conſiſts in a number out of Nations, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9. who are off from the beaſt and his thorne over conſciences, as ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately before the higheſt throne, and were not defiled with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, chap. 14.2, 3, 4. But theirs was whole Nations, good and bad to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: and they ſet up a beaſt originally derived from <hi>Rome,</hi> and by conſequence muſt in their Church-ſtate be a ſtrange woman, as is proved in Paragraph 1. Sect. 3. Indeed Antichriſt reigning long in his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique pontificalitie, grew ſo foul at laſt, that he was found out by the Proteſtants; and being diſcovered, was contented with them to ſit down in Epiſcopacy: but lording it there with too much tyranny, was alſo diſcloſed to be the ſame beaſt trimmed in other habit: and where he could not be admitted that attire (in policy, that he might the eaſier de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) masked himſelf under a more curious dreſs in Presbytery: yet his ground-work ariſing by deſcent from the Pope, is the ſame with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and he alſo there uſurps or chalengeth the like popedom over con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. The ſame beaſt remaines in all, onely his Kingdome is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</p>
                  <p>To your fifth Objection we anſwer, that by the word <hi>only,</hi> we exclude ſtating, not aſſembling for Miniſtery, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Your next Objections are directed againſt our ſeventh Reaſon, where we tell you, that we are yet but in the way towards <hi>Sion.</hi> Before we give a reply to yours, we ſhall acquaint you what we conceive of this ſubject, to prepare for that following. We hold, that there was a <hi>Sion,</hi> 2 Temple, a Woman, a Kingdome of grace, and a reigne of God therein through all Goſpel-times: yet withall, that this did not conſtantly abide in the external order of Eccleſiaſtical government, but was in its outward ſtand and diſpenſation various. In the primitive day, <hi>Sion</hi> was not onely inward in the work of grace and the hidden man, ſaith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but likewiſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:114948:53"/>viſibly ſtated by Chriſt in the glory of her outward order. In the dark night of Antichriſtianiſme, ſhe was more retired; ſubſiſting ſimply in the grace of Election, myſtical union, with ſome weak degree of profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and witneſs; had the badge of the covenant, but viſibly in a falſe, ſtrange and Babyloniſh conſtitution, as is cleared in the Ceſſation. After the final ſubverſion of Antichriſt, the like viſible government ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine deſcend from heaven: as is ſhewed in the Ceſſation alſo, Quaer. 2. This is diverſly ſtiled in the Prophets, anſwerable to the ſenſe it is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt, or applyed to. Sometimes (to teach us that before the Saints were outwardly a ſcattered and bondaged people in a ſtrange land or <hi>Babylon</hi>) the viſibilty of true Goſpel-order and regiment is by a Synecdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che termed <hi>Sion, Rev.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.</p>
                  <p>The ranſomed of the Lord return from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Sion.</hi> The redeemed ones were never abſented from the myſtical <hi>Sion;</hi> but from the viſible they were, and to that are ſaid to return. Likewiſe (to inform us that a myſtical or more inviſible <hi>Sion</hi> remained, and to point out in particular what failed, and what againe reverts) the Prophets tell us, that it is the viſibility of regiment ſhall be added to the former: as <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. after the vials wars are ended in a full peace, ver. 3.4. the Lord ſhal reigne (agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.6.) and then thou, O Tower of the flock, the ſtrong hold of the daughter of <hi>Sion,</hi> unto thee ſhall it come, even the firſt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, the Kingdome ſhall come to the daughter of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ver. 8. then judgement ſhall be given to the moſt high Saints, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.22. Now to apply this to our caſe, we affirme, that in the former of theſe two ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptations, we are in our way to Sion: in the latter, we are on Sion, expecting the glory of her government to come from the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>So that Sion in the Scriptures is ſometimes taken only for the myſtical, or mount of true grace, and thus it is in the times of the apoſtacy; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the viſible order of the Church-conſtitution, or outward rule. The not marking this, hath cauſed many, in the daies of this more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall adminiſtration, to bring the promiſes belonging to <hi>Sion,</hi> unto their ſtated formes, and ſo to <hi>Babylon,</hi> thereby deluding both themſelves and the people; thus did the Pope, thus did the Biſhops, and the like do all the reſt. We ſhall now proceed to remove your obſtacles.</p>
                  <p>Object. 1. <hi>It is the ſtate of all imbracing the Goſpel to be come to mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and the celeſtial Jeruſalem,</hi> Heb. 12.22.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This was ſpoken to the Goſpel-Church of the primitive day, who was <hi>Sion,</hi> as in the being and profeſſion of faith, ſo alſo in her out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward corporation and diſcipline; and cannot in its latitude be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all Goſpel-times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. To prove the perpetual ſucceſſion of a Goſpel <hi>Sion</hi> ſtated in outward order through the Antichriſtian age, you inſtance <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. Sion</hi> here ſpecified, figures out the mount of true grace, and the unmoveable foundation thereof. For all the Elect ſealed number, and only they, ſtood with the Lamb upon this mountaine: See the Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. If this be meant of a viſible conſtituted, Church then muſt if fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:114948:53"/>either that all the Elect in the world, and only they, through the whole ſeaſon of tribulation, muſt ſucceſſively in every generation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, be congregated apart by themſelves, and ſet in a true order diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the Papacy, Patriarkſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or elſe that <hi>Rome</hi> and the Greek Church as corrupt as ſhe, carrying this continuance of viſibility, muſt be true and orderly conſtitutions, made up of members elect and pretious, and none but ſuch. If the former be aſſerted, the Scripture and the event both manifeſt, that the Saints were ſcattered and mixed amongſt the nations: if the latter, more muſt attributed to <hi>Rome,</hi> then ſhe dares chalenge to her ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, this daughter of Sion was viſibly in <hi>Babylon,</hi> where all the beauty of her exteriour order was turned into confuſion, as you may at large read in the ſame Ceſſation; as alſo Parag. 1. Sect. 4.</p>
                  <p>Object. But, ſay you, <hi>This Sion muſt be viſible, becauſe ſeen of</hi> John.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This we alſo aſſent unto: for her inward grace was not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, but that it did in ſome meaſure manifeſt it ſelf in viſible profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and an holy godly life. And thus was one godly man to be ſeen of another, though mixed amongſt the common multitude: thus alſo the world eſpied them, and with us of late, branded them by the name of Puritans.</p>
                  <p>Your inſuing words tend to the confounding of two types parted by the Spirit; to wit, that of the one hundred fourty four thouſand, verſ. 1. and that of the harpers, verſ. 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That of the one hundred fourty four thouſand is a ſymbol of the elect remaining amongſt the common national Iſraelites, during the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty yeers of Antichriſt his prevailing, and ſome ſpace after, Chap. 7, to verſe the 9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That of the harpers is a new addition of a number, who are in their ſtand diſtinguiſhed and redeemed from amongſt men; which figures out the ſeparated people (as is declared in the beginning of this Paragraph) whoſe ſong was ſo intricate, that none amongſt the falſe Churches were capable of the myſtery, but the one hundred fourty four thouſand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from the earth, who by degrees will learn it, and come out of their intanglements.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We grant, that thoſe truly pious amongſt you may be and are of that catalogue, and ſtand upon the ſame Sion: but that all your national members, moſt of whom are prophane, are of this number, or that your reformers that were ſanctified, may be ſaved, though their works burn. Why you are not of theſe harpers, we ſhall inform you in the Poſtſcript.</p>
                  <p>Object. 3. <hi>Admit we be but in our way to Sion, yet what lets, but that we may ſet up all Gods ordinances, as well as ſome, in this our journey? The Iſraelites in their way to Canaan had all Gods ordinances ſet up amongst them.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Such ordinances as are ſpirited for abiding, may be and are exerciſed: ſuch whoſe adminiſtration lies void (as Ordination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Church-conſtitution) cannot, till the Lord inſpires them, as is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the firſt Paragraph. The example of the Iſraelites ſerves not for your purpoſe: For they were wholly ſeparated from <hi>Egypt;</hi> we are not ſo as yet from the great City: they firſt took their full journey to the place appointed, which was not mount <hi>Sion,</hi> but mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> the anſwered to the legal Jeruſalem, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24, 25. we are yet but in our journey of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, are not paſſed from <hi>Euphrates</hi> into the myſtical <hi>Canaan</hi> of a pure Goſpel-walk, nor to the Sion of viſible order, the peculiar centre of a Goſpel-marriage: they did not erect their legal conſtitution by themſelves; it was the Lord that framed it by his ſervant <hi>Moſes,</hi> and clouded it with his glory: much leſs can any now build up Goſpel-Churches, till our Lord Chriſt creates them by the deſcending influences of his Spirit.</p>

                  <p>The fourth is touching the temple, which was not opened for viſible entrance, till after the vials pouring, evidenced from <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.8. chap. 11.19. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.5, 6. Becauſe you complain that we have not explicated our ſenſe, we ſhall here briefly declare what we apprehend of the temple. To paſs by the temple of Chriſt manhood, wherein the eſſence of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dwels bodily, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.19, 20. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. we ſhall ſpeak of it, as it relates to the Saints and Goſpel-Church. And thus we underſtand the temple to be the houſe wherein the Lord inhabits by the preſence of his grace, Jeſus Chriſt being the chief corner-ſtone. And this may be either a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. or the compection and conjunction of the Saints, which is the intendment of the Spirit in the above-cited places. The ſame temple may be more hidden,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.1.</note> The firſt is ſpiritual and myſtical union of the Elect, and all the work of the graces, wherein the Lord dwels, as in a more ſecret habitation. The ſecond is, when toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the former, the Saints are knit together by the powerfull admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Spirit into an external corporation, ſtated with Officers, and having in their juriſdiction all the Ordinances belonging to viſible Church-power and Government: this is uſually called a ſtated or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Church. The inward rooms of true grace, with the inviſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, are the temple within; the outward Order is repreſented by the court without, verſ. 2. and is by a Synecdoche, the whole taken for the part, ſtiled the temple, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4. You may ſee by its ruines, what and how it was before its caſting out.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall lay down a few diſtinctions betwixt the myſtical, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible conſtituted temple: The former being combined by the inviſible bond of the Spirit, comprehends onely the elect ſealed number; the later, being an outward corporation, hypocrites may creep into: the one was always true during the time of the apoſtacie; the other was
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:114948:54"/>falſe and rejected in that ſeaſon; and when true, doth preſuppoſe the former: the firſt, when alone, hath a more ſparing breathing of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, with a hiding of his power, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.1. Chap. 11.1, 3. the later hath a manifeſt apparent-blaſt, as is ſaid, The temple was filled with ſmoke from the glory of God and his power, Chap. 15.8. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6. the like was in the Primitive, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.2. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.4. into the former, there is no viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble entry mentioned; it being internal, undiſcerned, and ſhut up from the outward court: the other hath an evident opening and entering. This word <hi>open</hi> argues a ſhutting before; and withal, preſuppoſeth ſmoking, or keys given by the viſible diſpenſation of the Spirit to open with, and alſo doors to be opened and entered by; which maketh it to be a ſtated Church: and will not be till after the<note n="*" place="margin">Verſ. 1<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The temple in Chap. 11.1, is a myſtical temple made up one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the one hundred and fourty four thouſand ſealed ones, as is ſhewed in Parag. 1.

Secondly, Of the harpers, or ſeparated people, verſ. 2, 3, 4, by their ſtand at the glaſſie ſea, which was in all the ſeaſon of ſeparation; by their victory over the Beaſt, that was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual by each vial, but completed by the laſt; and by their ſong, and praiſing of God for their ſeveral trophies, which goes hand in hand with every vial, and expires in the noble exulting Hallelujahs ſpecified Chap. 19. Thirdly, then, after theſe things, (to wit, after the conqueſt over Antichriſtian adverſaries is finiſhed, after the praiſes by that ſong are perfected) the temple of the tabernacle of the Teſtimony in heaven was opened; alſo Chap. 11.19, the ſame temple was opened after they were deſtroyed who deſtroyed the earth, and God had taken to him his great power, and had reigned; at that time likewiſe the marriage will come, chap. 19.7. So that this book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> moſt exactly, in all theſe three places, agrees in the ſame point of time wherein the viſible Church-marriage returns, and that is after the final overthrow of the beaſt and his adherents.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit having thus ſummarily delineated the whole figure of the ſeven Angels, ſeparation and marriage ſucceeding in common Types, goes back again with a further explication of the ſaid Angels ſpoken of verſ. 1, as that which prepares and furniſheth them for their pouring out wrath, Chap. 16. In verſ. 6, they come out of the temple, to wit, out from the elect number, to ſhew themſelves in open manifeſtation of pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and verſ. 7, the Beaſts or livings, who have the life and light of Gods
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:114948:55"/>Spirit in their Miniſtery, gave to the ſeven Angels ſeven vials to make them ready for their following work: and verſ. 8. tells us that the viſible opening for entrance ſpecified verſ. 5. cannot be till the ſeven Angels had fulfilled their plagues, and that after that the temple ſhall be ſmoaked and opened. Thus verſ. 6, 7, go along in order of ſtory with verſe 1, and furniſheth for pouring, Chap. 16. and verſ. 8. prepares by ſmoaking for the opening, verſ. 5. It is uſual in this book, firſt in brief to deſcribe generals, and after to come to ſome one or more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                  <p>If it be asked, how the ſeven Angels are ſaid to be in heaven, verſ. 1, and to come out of heaven, verſ. 6. as moſt Greek Copies have it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it beſt agrees with verſ. 1. We anſwer, that heaven is often taken for a high and prevailing power over others. Thus the Dragon with ſeven heads and ten horns, Chap. 12.3, is ſaid to be in heaven; to wit, in the high orb of regiment, from whence he was caſt down, verſ. 8, 9, 13. thus the Babylonian Monarchy exalted above others, is compared to heaven, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.53. So theſe Angels are ſeen in heaven; that is, an overſwaying adminiſtration of puiſſance over their enemies, both in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and war, who are beneath them as the low earth; and they above, as pouring down their wrath upon them: their vials are as the bottles of heaven dropping down plagues upon the world, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.18. Or if hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven do alſo note out brightneſs and purity, (as we conceive it doth) then the latter Angels are in a higher ſphere then the former, as acting in a loftier cauſe, and upon more ſublime principles. Hereupon many that go along aſſiſtants with the former, may be too low for the latter Angels, and proving adverſaries, have their wrath poured down upon their heads. And thus theſe Angels are declared to come out of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as coming from the number of the Elect, to ſhew themſelves in ſuch heroick deſigns, to be clothed with white linen, as being of the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, who had the like veſture, Chap. 7.9, and to be in and come out from heaven, as being in power and purity above the Antichriſtian world, and from thoſe noble principles, go forth to reap down all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers.</p>
                  <p>So that this temple whence theſe Angels come was the myſtical temple of the elect number, from whence the externality of order was exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, expreſſed Chap. 11.1, 2. and was not opened for viſible entrance till they had finiſhed their pouring upon Antichriſt, verſ. 19. If the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of the teſtimony of the temple was opened in the beginning of Proteſtantiſme, as you ſeem to aver, we ſhall deſire you to unfold unto us in your next reply, what the particulars thereof ſignifie; as the Mercy-ſeat, the Ark, the golden Pot, the Manna therein; How the Manna differs from the Shew-bread; What is <hi>Aarons</hi> rod that budded, and the tables of the teſtimony in their higheſt excellency; What are the Cherubims of glory; Why two; what are their wings; why alwayes ſtretched out, and meeting together, ſhadow the Mercy-ſeat; what are their faces; why they look inward; what is the golden Cenſer; why of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:114948:55"/>gold all within and without; what gold emblems, as diſtinct from ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, braſs and prerious ſtones; What they alſo type out; what is the ſecond veile; what is the candleſtick with its ſeven Lamps all of gold; what is table of the Shew-bread; the bread it ſelf, the Incenſe thereon; why only the ſuperficies was of gold, and the inſide Shittim wood; what i<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the golden altar, the fire, and the ſmoak of incenſe; why that alſo, was gold without, and wood within; how that is diſtinguiſhed from the brazen altar; what is the brazen altar; what is the firſt veile. Laſtly, what all theſe are in Chriſt; what in the Saints in general; what in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Saint in particular. All which will be clearly ſeen, when the veiles are removed, and this temple opened. If you who are experienced in all the tenents of the Proteſtants, and have the light and learning of the times to ſecond it, refuſe to interpret theſe myſteries, when requeſted, underſtanding men muſt either judge, that you neglect your duty in hiding your candle under a buſhel, or elſe that you with your party are not able to unfold the myſtery. Moſt will rather conclude the later, that theſe are not apparently open to your Church; that your viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is no part of this Temple opened, and that you meddle with Scriptures to prove the ſame, of whoſe ſenſe you are ignorant. We aſſure you, the higheſt degree of knowledge attainable in this life, lieth in the comprehending of theſe profundities, which (as we conceive) will not be apparently known, till the Spirit is againe poured out: at that time knowledge ſhall cover the earth, as waters cover the ſea, <hi>Habak.</hi> 2.14, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.6.

                  <p>Object. 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That of the high places belongs to the legal, not to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Church; who though after degenerated, yet in her firſt inſtitution was ſeparated wholly from Egypts defilements, was outwardly cleanſed before that covenant was given, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.14. had all her ordinances in the purity of divine inſtitution without any mixture of mens inventions. That external ſanctifying before the<note n="*" place="margin">

Beſides, the temple and Church at Jeruſalem was a true ſtated Church of God, and kept up in purity by ſome; but yours was never rightly conſtituted; and ſo the high places abroad in the country, could not fundamentally corrupt the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The ſin of Polygamy, was then accounted no ſin, becauſe, no law, no ſin
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:114948:56"/>imputed, and though partly connived at of old, yet, being more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with a Goſpel walk, was together with divorcement prohibited by our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.31, 32. The ſinful infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the regenerate, if viſible, were admoniſhable; and, if obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtood in, excommunicable. The primitive Church was very pure in her conſtitution, and was not to ſuffer leaven, leſt it ſhould leaven the whole lump, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6, 7. And, it being the Lords wiſdome in this laſt return, to bring his people firſt off by a full ſeparation, before he grant their viſible wedding-garments, who can controule, or argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him?</p>
                  <p>Object. 1 <hi>The Angels are clothed with white pure linen,</hi> Rev. 16.6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Angels are of the ſeparated people, who are clothed with the like white robes, Chap. 7.9. Theſe are ſaid to be white,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As they are garments of rejoycing and praiſe for their victory, Chap. 15.2, 3. which in Scripture-language are called white, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.3. alſo the Spirit by <hi>Zechariah,</hi> preſenting the ſtate of the four Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, ſets forth the Perſian, who brought joy and deliverance to the Jews, in the form of a white horſe; Chap. 6.3, 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In purity, as by way of compariſon, they are brighter then before, being off from the beaſt in Eccleſiaſticks; likewiſe in their Miniſtery, aimes and deſires, they are clear from Euphratean filth, and in that way of ſeparation which leads them over the river Euphrates. Albeit for the preſent, being on this ſide that river, they cannot in their practice be altogether free from ſome worldly uncleanneſs; the Spirit as yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing the higheſt righteouſneſs therein attainable, as is declared in our ſaid reaſon.</p>
                  <p>And for that the Miniſtery and minde is thus off from ſelf, and their way aſcending to a higher purity, the Spirit figures out the ſeparation and the Angels in the firſt general embleme, with the ſame whiteneſs and cleanneſs of array which will be attained to in the upſhot of the journey. Chriſt in this <hi>Revelation</hi> doth frequently pourtray things that go on gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually to ſuch a hight, firſt in a brief common type in the beginning, as they are in their extent, and after ſets down in particular the ſeveral ſteps by which they work up to the ſame utmoſt degree, as we ſhall evidence in our next Anſwer, by undeniable inſtances, if excepted againſt.

                  <p>In the laſt place, which is anſwerable to our ſecond Reaſon, we inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you that the viſible marriage of the Lamb in point of Church-order will not come till all enemies as Antichriſtian be ſubdued, and God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reigns, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.2, 3, 6, 7, 9.</p>
                  <p>Your firſt Objection againſt this, is that of <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.2. The third is the example of the Proteſtant Churches; to both which we have given Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in this Paragraph, Sect. 1.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall here add, that to do any thing in Church-matters without a call or divine warrant, is in Scripture-language a ſin of the higheſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: it being rebellion and preſumption, is idolatry, and like the ſin of Witchcraft, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. it was the ſin of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> as alſo of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abthu,</hi> together with <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza:</hi> Much more is it hainous to erect. Goſpel-tabernacles and Churches without a call and ſpiriting from heaven. This we conceive to be the fundamental cauſe and reaſon, why the Spirit gives to that of Antichriſtianiſm terms of ſuch deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and terror.

Hence it is chiefly, that the Beaſt is full of the names of blaſphemy, as if in all his ways he acted in that ſea, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.3. principally for this, the woman is ſaid to be the abomination of the earth, verſ. 5. and to be the habitation of devils, Chap. 18.2. hence are ſo great<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>And thus it will in ſhort time be diſcovered, as light increaſeth. And would you have us to ruſh into ſuch manner of ſins againſt our own light, to the hazarding of our own ſouls and others, through your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting that place of <hi>Haggai?</hi> Ceaſe, Maſter <hi>Elmſtone,</hi> from ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous courſes, and deſtructive ways. As for that of Proteſtant Churches, we deſire you in your next book to ſhew us out of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies their call for their ſeveral ſtated Churches, and their ſeveral forms both for matter and time, or otherwiſe to leave off ſuch impertinent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and remember what you aſſerted againſt <hi>Rome</hi> and the Biſhops.</p>
                  <p>Object. 2. <hi>This is to make Chriſt to be a Bridegroom without a known Bride, a King without a Kingdom, a Head without a Body, for more then a thouſand yeers; and ſo (as you elſewhere ſay) muſt bring a notable alteration in Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt is the ſame in himſelf, yeſterday, to day, and for ever; yet in his adminiſtration to his Church is various: ſometimes he is more ſecret and hidden, and in ſome reſpect abſent and gone: ſometimes ſeen with an open proſpect of his glorious diſpenſation: all which, though it cauſe an alterable condition in the Church, yet makes it no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute change in the Lord Jeſus. It is your own carnal apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:114948:57"/>that phancies ſuch a Soloeciſme in Divinity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To reply to the relation; the union betwixt Chriſt and his Church may be termed a marriage. This union is more myſtical and concealed, or more viſible and manifeſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The myſtical or more ſecret, is that where by the elect, however diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in reſpect of time, place, or condition, are related to Chriſt the head, and one to another. This alwayes continued; and thus Chriſt was ever a head, king and husband.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The more viſible Goſpel-marriage is, when the Saints outwardly congregated are by an open emiſſion of the Spirit firſt inveſted from above with new memberſhip and office, whereby to become a married wife; and they receiving this power from on high, do by vertue thereof marry others into the ſame married body, which is further declared in the Ceſſation, <hi>Quaere</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>And in this laſt regard ſhe was not alwayes married. For we are to mind, that herein there are ſeveral ſeaſons: times of love and maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for marriage, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8. and thus it was in the primitive, and will be againe at the laſt, when the Church in her external order appears a married wife, and Chriſt to her an husband in the open face of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious adminiſtration: and withal, in this conſideration there be times of minority, widowhood &amp; forſaking; as through the antichriſtian age, when the beloved in this ſecond ſenſe had withdrawn himſelf and was gone, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.6. the Church of the elect then in ſome reſpect in the ſtate of widowhood, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.4, 7. and one forſaken, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.4. the being no more forſaken, intimates a forſaking before; the marriage then coming, infers a non-marriage the ſeaſon preceding.</p>
                  <p>If it be demanded, how the marriage can be ſaid to return, when the covenant ſucceſſively remained; We anſwer, that the bare Goſpel-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, when not ſtated in the free and full glory of Evangelical regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, eſpecially when the viſible order is another, doth not in Scripture-language bear the dignity of a viſible Goſpel-marriage. For the ſame covenant of grace runs tacitely along through the Jewiſh legal ſtand, and had a ſecret ſaving influence on the godly; yet is not ſtiled a Goſpel-marriage till ſet in the majeſty of a Goſpel-order, and then the nuptials were ſolemnized, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p>So in the antichriſtian defection, the ſaid Covenant had ſome cloſe hidden being and breathing on the ſealed number; yet being deprived of the outward court of its regiment, and the Church-conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on becoming a ſtranger, it could not carry the prerogative of a true, ſingle, genuine, viſible Goſpel-marriage, till re-eſtated from Heaven in the power and beauty of its firſt dominion: and when this returns, the marriage of the Lamb is again ſaid to come, and not till then, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>Object. 4. <hi>It may as well be ſaid that there is no viſible marriage between Christ and particular Chriſtians before that time, as that there is none between Churches and Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:114948:57"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> As the marriage betwixt Chriſt and the Church was in this ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon onely more myſtical and hidden, ſo is it betwixt Chriſt and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> You go on and aſſert, <hi>That no particular Chriſtian can be a meet bride for Chriſt, who is not clothed with the pure, fine, and ſhining linen,</hi> viz. <hi>The righteouſneſs of the Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We aſſent, that without the righteouſneſs of Chriſt applyed by faith to the heart, there can be no union or marriage to Chriſt, and ſo no ſalvation. But this more internal work, when the outward ſtand is not anſwerable, is not anywhere in type figured out by the metaphor of garments; becauſe they being an outward covering, do uſually ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the viſible ſtation and walk of the Saints. Hereupon this viſible ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the godly ſince the Apoſtacie, is in the <hi>Revelation</hi> allegorically ſet forth by a threefold clothing, parallel to a treble condition.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That of the witneſſes and Elect while abiding in ſpiritual <hi>Babylon:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3.</note> who though they had the inward grace, yet being externally in falſe Churches, are emblem'd in the habit of black and filthy ſackcloth; their clothing being agreeable to their outward ſtand, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The raiment of the Virgins or ſeparated Saints in the ſeaſon of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,<note place="margin">Chap. 14.4.</note> which for that they are off from the beaſt and defiled women,<note place="margin">Chap. 9.7.</note> and in a more approved way then before, together with joy and triumph,<note place="margin">Chap. 15.6</note> is pictured in the forme of pure white linen: and this is the firſt to whom the type of white garments is attributed ſince the great defection.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The wedding garments given as a new grant by the pouring out of the Spirit,<note place="margin">Chap. 19.7, 9.</note> after the period of the former; which for their high, pure and emphaticall excellency of walk, are ſtiled the righteouſneſs of the Saints. Without this latter robe, neither many Saints in general, nor any one in particular, can be a meet bride for a viſible marriage with Chriſt; none can give it, till they firſt receive it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But you appropriate this marriage, chap. 19. to the Jewes, and thoſe wholy without.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That this belongs to all, as well to Gentile Chriſtians, as to the Jewes, and Pagans, we render theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The reigne of God is general, the marriage generall, the Spouſe married the whole Bride, the Lambs wife; the call is univerſall [they] which muſt comeprehend all the Saints. If the Chriſtian Gentiles be not concluded in this marriage, then are they no part of the bride, nor have any ſhare in the reigne, marriage, or the bleſſing thereof. View the text well, and your ſenſe cannot avoid this abſurdity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The people injoying and rejoycing in all this royall magnificence, are the ſingers for the utter deſtruction of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And not onely the Jewes, but the Gentiles alſo, who were the chiefe actors in her ruine, muſt queſtionleſs rejoyce in her downfall. Beſides, this book was ſent to the Chriſtian Gentiles, as principally pertaining unto them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The externality of Church-government amongſt the Gentile Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites (which carries the name and dignity of a Goſpel viſible marriage, as is ſhewed before) was caſt out when given to the Nations, chap. 11.2.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:114948:58"/>and ſince that excluſion, we find no return, grant and call for the reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereof (if not here) in this book; no, nor yet in any other Prophecie till this time: and at this very point of time, the whole current of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture foretels the ſame work to revert. Now, it is extream follie to think, that this Revelation ſhould not inform us when the glory of outward or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and rule ſhould be reſtored, as well as it teacheth us when it was ruined and rejected; or that all the prophecies beſides ſhould paſs it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in deep ſilence. We rather believe it then again to come, when the Spirit fore-declares it to be, and not before.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We agree to the rule of <hi>Iraeneus</hi> conſidered with this limitation, That prophecies cannot be compleatly known till cleared by the Event; and the further off the ſame time is, the greater veil lieth over them. But withall we do maintaine, that ſome degree of light may be gathered, by viewing the prophecies with their times; alſo by comparing Scripture
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:114948:58"/>with Scripture; and by minding types and things that are paſt, we may the better conclude what the like allegories repreſent in matters to come, when the Spirit (who ſearcheth all things, even the deep things of God) directs us in theſe myſteries. Beſides, ſome events being gradual, and coming one in the neck of another (as theſe of the vials are) hang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as it were in one chain: in which the beginning, preſents ſome aſpect of what will be in the end. Hence <hi>Jeremiah</hi> (fore-ſpeaking of the day of vials) ſaith, chap. 30.23, 24. chap. 23.19, 20, When the fury of the Lord falls on the head of the wicked, figured out by a whirlwind, that in the latter daies ye ſhall conſider it, and at laſt perfectly, to wit, the thoughts and itents of his heart, and his great works to come. Conſideration implyes a comprehenſion to the ſame time, of that which could not (by reaſon of the covering) be conſiderably known before: the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> likewiſe informs us, chap. 15.4, That then his judgements are made manifeſt. Moreover, this laſt ſeparation conſiſteth in the underſtanding of things paſt, preſent, and to come; paſt, as to number the beaſt, (from whom they diſtinguiſh) in his riſe, foundation, and whole latitude; preſent, whereby to know the way and walk now approved; and to come, ſo as to have an eye to the Saints and <hi>Sion</hi> and marriage, which is <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus ad quem,</hi> the end, ſcope or reſting place which this their paſſage aimes at. A traveller hath ſome apprehenſion of the place he travels to. Therefore have they their ſtation on a glaſſie ſea, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.2. and are promiſed to ſee eye to eye, when the Lord returns again <hi>Sion, Iſa.</hi> 52.8. This will be fully at the upſhot, and yet ſo far for the preſent, as to guide them in their walk and almes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> You further charge againſt us, <hi>that theſe prophecies are ſubject to various interpretations; and that the miſtakes and differences of other learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, may teach us not to build ſuch lofty opinions upon, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The plaineſt texts of Scripture are ſubject to various, nay diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting interpretations, as well as theſe: hence ariſe ſo many differences about Epiſcopacie, Presbytery, Independencie, Poedo baptiſme, Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, with innumerable others: yet theſe divided principles ought not to weaken the force of any truths drawn from thoſe texts. The ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that reveales the mind of other Scriptures, may unclock the myſtery of theſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The cauſe of ſuch variety and miſtakes of the godly in former ages, is the veile foretold to be caſt over men during the time of tribulation. But now the Lord hath promiſed to remove this covering from his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning people. And this will have more force to highten us in ſearching into theſe profundities, then all the diſcouragements of men to beat us back.</p>
                  <p>If it be true, that <hi>nihil datur fruſtra,</hi> nothing in the ordinary courſe of providence be vain, is it then ſafe to imagine that the ſolemn Goſpel-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, chap. 1.3. can be a meer empty ſound, and ſuch as drives men to bare conjectures and trifling probabilities, unmeet to lay the weight of any real determinations upon? Or is the book opened, chap. 10. without
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:114948:59"/>any certaine diſcovery of the myſtery therein comprehended? Or did the ſame Spirit which invites to count the beaſt, chap. 13.18. lay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient grounds and rules to find out his number? Or is that mighty voice and call from heaven, chap. 18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.6. void of light and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to dictate what they ought to ſeparate from, the way they ſhould walk in, and thoſe nuptials they are preparing for? We rather believe the ſayings of this book to be the true ſayings of God, chap. 19.9. and to be true and faithfull, chap. 22.6. and to contain matters of tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent worth, and ſolid foundations for knowledge, practice and argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. And though the ſpirituality thereof lie deep (as things of rareſt excellency uſually do) yet ſuch of wiſdomes children who are divinely inſpired with an underſtanding Spirit, will by vertue of that power aſſiſting them, thence draw out thoſe precious truths, which will confound and put to ſilence the wiſdome of the world. It is very remarkable, that the teſtimony of Jeſus in theſe latter ages, is called the Spirit of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, chap. 19.10. The reaſon is, becauſe the prophecies hold forth that very diſpenſation, and thoſe Judgements of God proper to our owne generation; which rightly teach us how to diſtinguiſh the times, and to know the things that belong to our peace in this our day: the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance whereof may occaſion the miſery of man to be great, becauſe he miſſeth his time.</p>
                  <p>This, and all your other arguments of the ſame nature, are no other for ſubſtance, then what were formerly made uſe of by the Papiſts and Epiſcopaliſts againſt your ſelves; which have not the leaſt might to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten, or ſtrip us of our birth-right in this prophecie, though coming from Mr. <hi>Elmeſtone.</hi> I ſhall wiſh you for the future, either to diſprove our interpretation, and give a better and clearer ſenſe, or forbear to ſpeak evil of what you know not.</p>
                  <p>Now come we to your concluding argument ſpecified in the 36 page of your book; wherein you lay a high charge againſt our way and Tenents, as if they were againſt the ſecond and fourth Commandments, the three firſt Petitions, and a hinderance to mens ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We have already removed the violence of all this after-charge in ſeverall paſſages of this treatiſe. This general return will here ſuffice; in which we utterly deny your accuſation; and affirme, that to follow Chriſt in the path of ſeparation, to exerciſe in this our journey thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances now inſpired by his Spirit, both in private, as alſo in our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique aſſemblies, eſpecially on the Lords day, with a forbearance of the reſt for the preſent, which lie voide of his adminiſtration, till his glory return from heaven to ſanctifie them againe for uſe, thereby avoiding the idols that muſt neceſſarily inſue upon taking them up, can be no breach, but a fulfilling of the ſecond and fourth Commandments both in the affirmative and negative part: and this, being grounded on the call and warrant of our Lord Jeſus, muſt be done in his name, advance his kingdom, fall into the compaſs of his divine will and pleaſure, agreeable to the three firſt petitions. The Virgins going forth to meet the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:114948:59"/>was a preparatory to that illuſtrious marriage, wherein Chriſt in the open proſpect of his diſpenſation will appear a husband, and they that are wiſe a married wife when entred into the wedding-chamber of the Lamb. I ſay, this high way in the wilderneſs, being the medium and paſſage to that ſpiritual magnificence, tends to exalt the glory, throne, ſcepter, and kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt. And this walk can no way hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſalvation of our ſelves or others, but bends to the furtherance thereof; as the conſciences of many can teſtifie, who have found the miniſtery to be as waters ſpringing out of the deſart, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.21. chap. 41.17, 18. even when they could obtaine no ſuch new riſing ſprings of refreſhments with you.</p>
                  <p>But Sir, Seeing you have ſo furiouſly charged againſt us, we ſhall intreat you to reflect upon your own way (for, <hi>noſce teipſum,</hi> know your ſelves, is the firſt point of wiſdome) and you may with eyes anointed with ſpiritual eye-ſalve, diſcerne, that you uſurpe a power onely proper to the King of Saints, to ſet up viſible Churches, to make members and officers upon your owne call, power and ſpiriting; and that by omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome of the primitive ordinances, and placing other inventions in their ſtead. Thus to erect a beſtial Idol with ſubjection thereto, muſt be directly oppoſite to the ſecond Commandment: and having built up ſuch a golden Calf, can do no leſs then blemiſh and defile all your ſervices in your aſſemblings on the Lords day, contrary to the fourth command: and withall you bottoming the ſame upon your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations, without a celeſtial inveſtment firſt as power from above, muſt honour your owne names, derogating from the name of Chriſt; ſet up and magnifie your owne kingdomes, eclipſing and darkning his, do your owne wills in oppoſition to the will of God; and by this, undermin'e the three firſt petitions. Which machination of yours, ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo againſt the radix of Divinity, can no way forward the ſalvation of ſoules, but is prejudicial, and a drawing people to diſobedience; not a bearing up of the ſtative ordinances, wherein his ſoveraign power and goodneſs will be ſet forth, but a laying them upon a humane Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian baſe, and thereby ſo changing them, that they carry the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtical name, ſpirit and wiſdome of man, the very Image of a beaſt; not an eſtabliſhing of doctrine therein, and a right officiated miniſtery, but a broaching of errors, a conſtituting and bearing up of a deluſive Miniſtery, as a falſe Chriſt and falſe Prophet, the foundation of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely and miſleading viſibilities (for though ſometimes you preach up God and Chriſt onely, as coming in his Name in pretence, yet you eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh &amp; teach up another in diſcipline, therein coming in your own name;) not a preventing of ſcandals, and reſtraining licentious living by true diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, but a cauſing ſcandals and offences by a falſe, not onely in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons, but in your whole unſeaſonable ſtated Churches; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it brings a general wo, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18 6. and this miſerable <hi>Scotland</hi> hath experienced, in whom your greateſt boaſt, glory, and hope of and for your Presbyterian Government reſided. You may plainly ſee how God worketh againſt ſuch deſignes.</p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:114948:60"/>
                  <p> It is true, that in the Primitive day, when Church-Government came from Chriſt, and manifeſt ſmoke, winde, fire and lightning of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which breathed in and operated by the ſtative Ordinances of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Confirmation, Church-cenſures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there was the life, light, and glory of the ſame Spirit, which preſented the ſoveraign power, beauty and wiſdom of Jeſus Chriſt the husband, and made them effectual means for the perfecting and completing of the Church his ſpouſe. But ſince this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternality was forſaken and rejected by the Spirit, and the key thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grounded barely upon an humane Antichriſtian baſe, became bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the ſame Ordinances have been found to be lifeleſs, and empty of their primitive excellencie; not to have the leaſt vertue to convey any ſpiritual nutriment to the Saints, but rather to increaſe formality, and decreaſe the power of godlineſs. Nay, they ſpringing from a beſtial root, have brought forth ſuch bitter fruit, as hath been moſt oppoſite to the workings of the Spirit of grace. This key of Regiment through the Weſt remained ſolely in the hands of <hi>Rome</hi> for many ages, where it clouded and by degrees darkned the whole Hemiſphere with the poyſonous ſumes and exhalations ariſing from that bottomleſs furnace: and though at firſt it came in more mildly in a lamb-like viſage, yet at laſt when diſcovered, it brake out into ſuch open rage againſt the godly, as hath filled the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles with moſt ſad and tragical ſtories. Of later yeers in <hi>England,</hi> it was taken thence and tranſplanted into the Biſhops, who by the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof ſo trampled upon the Saints, that we are all ſenſible of that Antichriſtian ſpirit therein raigning and triumphing. And thoſe places where the Presbyterian Diſcipline hath had the full ſwinge, and was back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſword of the Magiſtrate, are known to abound with more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, worldly mindedneſs, nay open prophaneſs, then is uſually to be found with us in <hi>England;</hi> where alſo ſome precious men, who could not lay their conſciences paſſive to their yoke of tyranny, have felt the ſtripes of their cruelty ſo deep in their perſons and eſtates, as hath forced ſome to flee from their native Country; witneſs <hi>Scotland.</hi> The ſame ſpirit in our leſſer Corporations, acts its chiefeſt ſtrength in diſuniting of the Lords people, where alſo the above-named Ordinances are lifeleſs and ineffectual: and this many (the choiceſt amongſt them) begin to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of. It is onely the myſtical Church or foundation of true grace, that is the pillar and ground of truth, while the outward court is caſt out, and becomes the baſe of falſhood.</p>

               <p>WE ſhall in the laſt place paſs to your Poſtſcript, where you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from <hi>Rev.</hi> 15, who the harpers are that ſtand at the glaſſie ſea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe harpers are a ſeparated, not a ſtated people, which we have evidenced in the fourth and fore-going Paragraph, and proved by ſeveral Reaſons. We ſhall here more amply decipher their nature, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and ſtand, out of the three ſeveral texts of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> in which the Spirit paints them forth.</p>
               <p>The firſt is Chap. 7. v. 9. There you may ſee them not to be whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but a great number of, or out of nations, being choſen from the reſt, who ſtand immediately before the throne of grace, clothed with white robes of rejoycing, praiſe, and virgin-like purity, all palms in their hands, an enſigne of victory and peace, and alluding to the multitude who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and cried <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> when Chriſt rode up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Mat. 21.8, 9. <hi>Mark</hi> 11.8, 9, 10. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.37, 38. all which attributes a difference of them from the ſealed number and Witneſſes before. Verſ. 14, they come out of great tribulation, which manifeſteth the time to be after the 1260 yeers. Verſ. 15, theſe for their diligence in holy exerciſes, are ſaid to ſerve God day and night in his temple: their hungering and thirſting no more, nor the ſun and heat lighting on them, v. 16. infers the ſpiritual famine and affliction they underwent the preceding ſeaſon, from which now they are perpetually freed. Their ſeeding by the lamb, their being led to living fountains of water, anſwers to the fertility and ſprings of water (for ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtrengthning and recreating) breaking forth in the wilderneſs, or high-way there to <hi>Sion, Iſa.</hi> 35.6, 7. chap. 41.18. chap. 48.21. chap. 49.9, 10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.35. and to the precious promiſes made to the ſame people, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. from verſ. 14. to 19. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.16.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Scripture is Chap. 14. Verſ. 1, is a type of the ſealed number under Antichriſtiſme, expreſſed chap. 7. from verſ. 1. to 9. who ſtand upon the myſtical mount of election, or grace. The ſeparated Saints are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented from verſ. 2. where they are not onely rejoycers as before, but harpers, they ſinging for joy of heart, and tuning their ſounding inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of praiſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.10. Chap. 30.29. Their ſong for matter, v. 3. is a new ſong, ſutable to the new work then created for them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.19. Chap 42.16.9, 10. which was ſo abſtruſe and myſterious, that none amongſt the nations and falſe ſtands could truely learn it, but the 144000 redeemed from the earth, who by degrees will be capable thereof, come out, and joyn with the harpers. Verſ. 4, theſe are not defiled with women, which notes their ſeparation from all falſe Churches either of the wilderneſs or ſecret chambers; for they are virgins, preparing for the marriage to come in chap. 19. and as the Lord goes before them, ſo do they follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goes, from vial to vial, both in ſeparating from, and rewarding of: they are not onely redeemed from the earth with the 144000, but alſo purchaſed from amongſt men, which hints
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:114948:61"/>at their ſeparation from the reſt of the world: and being the firſt thus bought, have the honour of being the firſt fruits unto God and the Lamb. In verſ. 5, for the pureneſs and ſincerity in their Miniſtery, which brings Divinity up into a Goſpel-glory, they are ſaid to have no guile in their mouthes, for they are without fault before the throne.</p>
               <p>The third text is Chap. 15. v. 2, 3, 4. in which their victory, ſtation, and ſong, are more diſtinctly and accurately deſcribed. Verſ. 2, their victory is over the Beaſt, (to wit, all uſurped Hierarchies over conſciences, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Romiſh, Epiſcopal, Presbyterial, of any other) his Image, (their ſtated Frames and Ordinances formed according to their carnal imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations) his Mark, (a ſubjection thereto:) from all which the harpers are redeemed; and from the number of his name, as a people ſeparated in their diſtinguiſhed aſſemblies. Their ſtand was on a glaſſie ſea, the clear, pure, bright ſenſings of Scripture; which for the copiouſneſs is called <hi>a ſea;</hi> for its perſpicuity, <hi>of glaſs,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. which is mingled with fire, to conſume the timber, hay, and ſtubble of Antichriſtian mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.18, and to purge the filth of the Saints by the ſpirit of judgement, and by the ſpirit of burning, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.4. In verſ. 3, their ſong is the ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Lamb, for their outward and ſpiritual delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; the ſubſtance of which is compendiouſly drawn out in verſ. 3 &amp; 4. the like is declared in Chap. 14.7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And theſe, for time, aroſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently with the Angel-pourers, as appears by their being conjoyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, verſ. 1, 2. by their victory and triumphant ſong, which begins with and continues all the ſeries of the vials. Theſe judgements and wonders of God have been of late ſo clearly manifeſted with us, that no man ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually enlightned can gainſay it.</p>
               <p>Having thus delivered the ſtate of theſe harpers, we ſhall now acquaint you why your National Churches, whether Epiſcopal or Presbyterial, are none of their number. They for time aroſe long before the 1260 yeers of tribulation were ended, and were not a ſelected company out of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor redeemed from amongſt men, but were whole nations good and bad incorporated into one leprous body: they were not clothed with white robes of joy, praiſe, and purity, nor ſtand immediately before the throne; but even the godly amongſt them were clothed in ſack-cloth, ſtood viſibly in the ſtreets of the great city, and before earthly Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, who as terrene gods lorded it over them, whereby the ſun and heat ſmote them, as was too well known in the Biſhops times, and by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of others elſewhere both before and ſince: neither are you a growing people, with an increaſe of ſpiritual nouriſhment, and new riſing ſprings of heavenly refreſhings; but are declining to more formality and deadneſs, and will daily decreaſe, as the light of Truth increaſeth; your kingdom grows full of darkneſs: neither do you return from <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> but ſit down in that deſart. Thus you may take notice how contrary you are to the ſeparated people expreſſed Chap. 7. Give us leave to ſhew you how unlike your National Churches ruled by Biſhops or Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, are to the harpers painted out in Chap. 14. They ſing not the

                  </gap> and applauding him: they ſtand not immediately before the higheſt throne, but before Claſſical, Provincial, and National Synods, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a <hi>medium</hi> between, and ruling over the conſcience: they are not virgins in their purity from the Beaſt, nor wait they for the marriage to come, nor are undefiled with ſtrange women; but are ſtrange women, boaſting with her, Chap. 18.7, that they ſit as Queens, are already marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their viſible conſtitutions, and their members defiled with the ſame falſe married Churches: they follow not the Lamb in his call of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but go before him in their own of ſtating: they are not redeemed from amongſt men, as herein obtaining the honour of the firſt-fruits, in whoſe mouth is ſound no guile; but remain bondaged themſelves, and labour to enthral others (as their frequent importuning the Magiſtrate for power to compel, doth teſtifie) ſtill retaining their old muſtie ſtore, and ſowre wilde grapes of Antichriſt; your Miniſtery is foully corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with guile, and falſe principles about diſcipline, accompanied with bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and odious invectives againſt theſe harpers. Laſtly, let us examine your National Churches above-named by Chap. 15. They ſtand not ſimply upon a ſea of glaſs, the word only purely ſenſed, but upon the more groſs interpretations of the Fathers and other learned men in darker times, from whom they eſteem it preſumption to differ, though to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Truth, as your ſharp and frequent reproofs of me for differing from them, doth demonſtrate: they have not obtained a conqueſt over the Beaſt, but have erected a Beaſt in Epiſcopacie, Presbytery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his Image in their Canons and other Ordinances changed into his likeneſs; his Mark, by a ſubjection thereto: nor are their members in diſtinct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregatings, as being off from the number of his name, but are all num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered to him. And thoſe who now adhere to theſe National Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, are ſo far from harping out this triumphant ſong of victory by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and war, and ſinging, <hi>True and righteous are thy ways herein, thou King of Saints;</hi> as they are ſecret mourners, having a wound in their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits at theſe his juſt proceedings, and his judgements now made manifeſt: witneſs of late the dolour for the overthrow of the Scots, who fought in the Presbyterian cauſe; your publike reproaches againſt the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with inward torments for their freedom, together with many other paſſages; which ſhew, how this great work of God now beginning, is cloſed and faſt locked up from your underſtandings. We deſire from our ſouls, that the Lord Jeſus, who hath the key of <hi>David,</hi> would open the door of your hearts, whereby his admired deſignes, changes, and works to be done, might enter. In the mean time, you may behold your fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in bringing thoſe texts to convince us, and prove your practice, every circumſtance whereof agrees with the way of ſeparation, and riſeth up as ſo many witneſſes againſt yours.</p>
               <p>You ask us, <hi>Whether the Ordination of Miniſters in ſuch National Churches, be a mark of the Beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Seeing the Churches themſelves are not theſe harpers, but
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:114948:62"/>ſuch as ſtand under a beſtial power, the Miniſters muſt be of the ſame nature with the Churches. And your Ordination, whether by Biſhops or preaching Presbyters coming from the corrupt key of <hi>Rome</hi> (though done by faſting and prayer) muſt carry with it the mark or brand of the ſame Beaſt; or if the man be truely pious, his outward livery. And thus to judge, is neither ignorance nor malice, as you charge it, but the diſcovery of Chriſt in his Revelation, who through our ſides you are pleaſed to defame with black terms of obloquie.</p>
               <p>To your next, we ſay that you are not clothed with the white garments of the harpers, but with the black habit of ſack-cloth.</p>
               <p>You tax us with omitting ſinging of Pſalms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For mine own particular, I queſtion not the Ordinance of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſinging of Pſalms, though ſome do ſcruple the manner thereof, as conceiving it to be much abuſed. Albeit this harmonizing here, is not tyed to metre, but is the inward joy wrought in the hearts of Gods ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Saints for their noble redemption from the Beaſt, and the new mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies beſtowed on them, which breathes forth either in ſecret ejaculations, or acts more openly in Miniſtery, Prayer, Thankſgiving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You quaere. <hi>How we can be in our return from Babylon, and yet within Babylons territories.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> A man may be returning from <hi>London,</hi> and yet within the line of Communication: ſo in this gradual ſeparation, we cannot go clear off at once, but by degrees. See Parag. 4. Reaſ. 7.</p>
               <p>Before we conclude, give us leave to propound a few Quaeries very material to be conſidered of:
<list>
                     <item>1. In general for all.</item>
                     <item>2. In particular to you.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The general ſhall be a brief contracting of the whole body of this Controverſie; and are as followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether the being of yours or any other Office with us paſſing by ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Primitive, came by a Lineal deſcent from</hi> Rome, <hi>or not. If ſome ſay Not, then whether any can prove their Genealogie diſtinct and apart from her. If from</hi> Rome, <hi>(as you confeſs) then whether the eſſence and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Office be true there, or not. If true, then whether ſhe muſt not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically be a true Church and a</hi> Sion. <hi>If ſhe be in her conſtitution falſe, bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs, and</hi> Babylon, <hi>whether there were not a diſſolution of your line and chain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether a true congregated Church, ſet in a right and compleat order of diſcipline in our Weſtern Horizon, can be proved from the Apoſtolical times to be diſtinct from the Romiſh Synagogue. If not (as the Scripture and the event doth clearly manifeſt) then muſt there be a ceſſation and departure of Gods glory from this viſibility, proved from theſe Scriptures:</hi> Rev. 7.1. Chap. 9.1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chap. 11.2.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:114948:62"/> 3. <hi>Whether (the primitive order ſinking) there muſt not be a new call and ſpiriting from God for the firſt reſtoring and beginning of this work, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his glory may return to make it a true ſpiritual and heavenly build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Whether ſuch a viſible adminiſtration that gives being to a true, pure, genuine and ſingle Goſpel-marriage be to be ſeen in the firſt initiation of any of our new-built Church-formes, or can be evidenced by Scripture to be exiſting at this preſent, or whether this ſame be not propheſied not to return till after the downfall of</hi> Babylon, <hi>by theſe Scriptures,</hi> Rev. 19.2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>chap.</hi> 11. 19. Hoſ. 2.19, 20. Iſa. 62.4, 5. <hi>chap.</hi> 14.15. Mic. 4.3, 8. Mat. 25.10.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Whether (if ſo) all our viſible conſtitutions muſt not be man in their ground-work, and ſo numbered to that beaſt,</hi> Rev. 13.18.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Whether then the way prepared, caſt up, approved of and called unto for his Servants now to walk in, be not a ſeparation with diſtinct Congregations, without ſitting down as Queens in viſible conſtitutions. I ſhall deſire the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeriouſly and impartially to examine theſe Quaeries by the word of God. We were all in a ſpiritual ſenſe aſleep: and it is no ſhame, but a honour to yeild to the conqueſt of truth, and ſuffer it freely to triumph over our former miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadings and wanderings</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Quaeries in particular to you, are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether (as above) your Office of the Miniſtery (the corner-ſtone of your outward building) being derived from the national hierarchy, which ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came from the Pope, be not one of Babylons ſtones: and whether it be not against this text,</hi> Jer. 51.26. They ſhall not take of thee a ſtone for foundations, but thou ſhalt be deſolate for ever, ſaith the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether your gathering of Goſpel-Churches out of true Goſpel-Churches (which you acknowledge the national to be) be warranted by the Scriptures: if ſo, we deſire your proofs for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Whether your making of Elders without laying on of hands, be agreeable to the primitive practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Whether the receiving in of members made by your ſelves, be taken from the primitive pattern: that is, whether ſuch a Covenant, and ſubſcription thereto, was the Ordinance by which men entred into Church-fellowſhip in that Goſpel-day; or whether members were not then received in by laying on of hands: if by ſuch a Covenant, we deſire your Scriptures to warrant it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Whether all this be not to omit, or tranſgreſs the lawes, and change the ordinances,</hi> Iſa. 24.6.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:114948:63"/>
               <p> Yet one thing more. You have taken a great deal of pains through your whole Book, to prove a true viſible ſtated Goſpel-Church thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Goſpel-times: but all this while you have not ſhewed us which of all the ſeveral forms is that true ſtated Church. <hi>Rome</hi> arrogates it, the <hi>Lutherans</hi> uſurp it, the <hi>Engliſh Epiſcopacie</hi> plead it, the <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>you</hi> chalenge it, the <hi>Dippers</hi> appropriate it, thoſe called <hi>Browniſts</hi> claim it as their ſole intereſt, the <hi>Independents</hi> aſſume it. And truely, the wiſeſt man in <hi>Europe</hi> taking a thorow view of every one of theſe Church-models, will be at a ſtand certainly to determine which of them is the true and right; and which had its lineal deſcent in the rectitude of Order from the Primitive. The more accurately he examines, the greater occaſion he may finde to queſtion all.</p>
               <p>Sir, I beſeech you not to take in prejudice, what I have here preſented in benevolence. For though many things may appear ſomething ſtrange at firſt, yet, I hope, upon ſecond thoughts you will finde them no other then the real truths of God, delivered by the Prophets, Apoſtles, and the Lord himſelf. I preſume you will not adjudge him, who hath been and is your cordial friend, to become your enemy, becauſe he tells you the truth, and that in the ſame language the Spirit in Scripture ſpeaks. Indeed, I may ſeem to ſome to be over-ſharp: but the diſcoveries by the vials are ſo imparted by the Spirit, as at the one ſide to increaſe the torments of the marked ſouldiers of Antichriſt, ſo on the other ſide thorowly to ſearſe and eat out the myſtery of that deceit too deeply riveted in the mindes of many veſſels of honour. For though the Spouſe was not totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſo as to be ſtruck at the heart or killed, yet was ſhe ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded, as to receive a wound, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.7. which cannot recover a perfect cure, but by a ſearching ſalve. And for my ſelf, I dare not daub in the things of God, nor call evil good, nor darkneſs light, nor ſoothe up with flattering titles, left my Maker ſhould deſtroy me. When I ſee my brother ſtraying, I am commanded to rebuke with plainneſs, and not in any wiſe to ſuffer ſin to reſt upon him, to omit which duty were a ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome of hatred, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. And I will aſſure you, they are no other then the faithful wounds of a friend, which in receiving, may carry the vertue of an excellent oil, that will not break your head, but onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move ſuch putrefaction, as might otherwiſe procure your loſs at the day of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
